### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic seeks to detect the creation of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) permanent event subscriptions, a technique often used by adversaries for persistence. Such a subscription allows for the execution of specified scripts or binaries in response to defined system events, potentially enabling malicious activities to persist unnoticed. The analytic uses Sysmon Event ID 5 data, specifically focusing on instances where consumers of these events are not the expected &#34;NTEventLogEventConsumer.&#34; Although WMI event subscriptions can be used legitimately by administrators, unusual or unexpected subscription creation should be treated as suspicious. Analysts need to be cognizant of the potential for false positives in legitimate administrative activities and should understand WMI activity within the context of the monitored environment.

#### Search

```
`wmi` EventCode=5861 Binding 
| rex field=Message "Consumer =\s+(?<consumer>[^;
|^$]+)" 
| search consumer!="NTEventLogEventConsumer=\"SCM Event Log Consumer\"" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, consumer, Message 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| rename ComputerName as dest 
| `wmi_permanent_event_subscription_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wmi](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wmi.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **wmi_permanent_event_subscription_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* Message
* consumer
* ComputerName



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
#### Known False Positives
Although unlikely, administrators may use event subscriptions for legitimate purposes.
