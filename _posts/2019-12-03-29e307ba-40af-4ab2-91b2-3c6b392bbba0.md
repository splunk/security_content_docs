#### Description

This search looks for reading loaded Images unique to credential dumping with Mimikatz. Deprecated because mimikatz libraries changed and very noisy sysmon Event Code.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=7 
| stats values(ImageLoaded) as ImageLoaded values(ProcessId) as ProcessId by dest, Image 
| search ImageLoaded=*WinSCard.dll ImageLoaded=*cryptdll.dll ImageLoaded=*hid.dll ImageLoaded=*samlib.dll ImageLoaded=*vaultcli.dll 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `detect_mimikatz_using_loaded_images_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_mimikatz_using_loaded_images_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ImageLoaded
* ProcessId
* dest
* Image



#### How To Implement
This search needs Sysmon Logs and a sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 7 with powershell.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
#### Known False Positives
Other tools can import the same DLLs. These tools should be part of a whitelist. False positives may be present with any process that authenticates or uses credentials, PowerShell included. Filter based on parent process.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | A process, $Image$, has loaded $ImageLoaded$ that are typically related to credential dumping on $dest$. Review for further details. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
