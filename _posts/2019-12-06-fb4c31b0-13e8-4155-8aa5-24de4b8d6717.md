#### Description

The following analytic detects the dumping of the LSASS process memory, which occurs during credential dumping attacks.The detection is made by using Sysmon logs, specifically EventCode 10, which is related to lsass.exe. This helps to search for indicators of LSASS memory dumping such as specific call traces to dbgcore.dll and dbghelp.dll. This detection is important because it prevents credential dumping attacks and the theft of sensitive information such as login credentials, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. False positives might occur due to legitimate administrative tasks. Next steps include reviewing and investigating each case, given the high risk associated with potential credential dumping attacks.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=10 TargetImage=*lsass.exe CallTrace=*dbgcore.dll* OR CallTrace=*dbghelp.dll* 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, TargetImage, TargetProcessId, SourceImage, SourceProcessId  
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `access_lsass_memory_for_dump_creation_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **access_lsass_memory_for_dump_creation_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* TargetImage
* CallTrace
* dest
* TargetProcessId
* SourceImage
* SourceProcessId



#### How To Implement
This search requires Sysmon Logs and a Sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 10 for lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators can create memory dumps for debugging purposes, but memory dumps of the LSASS process would be unusual.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 70 | 90 | process $SourceImage$ injected into $TargetImage$ and was attempted dump LSASS on $dest$. Adversaries tend to do this when trying to accesss credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
