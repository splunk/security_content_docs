#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect the potential misuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for malicious purposes. WMI can be utilized by adversaries to execute scripts, a method often employed for maintaining stealth while carrying out malicious activities. The process &#39;scrcons.exe&#39;, integral to executing WMI scripts, is primarily monitored by this analytic. The underlying threat lies in the fact that successful execution of a malicious script can lead to numerous negative outcomes, including system compromise, data exfiltration, or the establishment of persistence. It&#39;s essential for cybersecurity analysts to remain vigilant towards unexpected or isolated script executions via WMI, as such instances often signal suspicious activities or potential security breaches. Although uncommon, administrators may occasionally use WMI to launch scripts for legitimate purposes. Therefore, discerning malicious activities from benign ones is crucial in this context.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **script_execution_via_wmi_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.user
* Processes.dest



#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity, including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the &#34;process&#34; field in the Endpoint data model.
#### Known False Positives
Although unlikely, administrators may use wmi to launch scripts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | A wmic.exe process $process_name$ that execute script in host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
