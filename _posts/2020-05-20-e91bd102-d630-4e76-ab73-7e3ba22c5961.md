### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This search looks for child processes spawned by zoom.exe or zoom.us that has not previously been seen.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/previously_seen_zoom_child_processes_window.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **first_time_seen_child_process_of_zoom_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [zoom_first_time_child_process](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/zoom_first_time_child_process.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/zoom_first_time_child_process.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.dest



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
A new child process of zoom isn&#39;t malicious by that fact alone. Further investigation of the actions of the child process is needed to verify any malicious behavior is taken.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Child process $process_name$ with $process_id$ spawned by zoom.exe or zoom.us which has not been previously on host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
