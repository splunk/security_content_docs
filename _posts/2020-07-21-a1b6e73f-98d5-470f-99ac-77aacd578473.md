#### Description

This search looks for command-line arguments that use a `/c` parameter to execute a command that has not previously been seen.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **first_time_seen_command_line_argument_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv)
* [previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.dest



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
Legitimate programs can also use command-line arguments to execute. Please verify the command-line arguments to check what command/program is being executed. We recommend customizing the `first_time_seen_cmd_line_filter` macro to exclude legitimate parent_process_name
