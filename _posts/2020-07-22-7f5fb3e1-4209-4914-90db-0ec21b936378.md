### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects spikes in the number of Server Message Block (SMB) traffic connections. SMB is a network protocol used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between computers. This detection is made by a Splunk query that looks for SMB traffic connections on ports 139 and 445, as well as connections using the SMB application. The query calculates the average and standard deviation of the number of SMB connections over the past 70 minutes, and identifies any sources that exceed two standard deviations from the average. This helps to filter out false positives caused by normal fluctuations in SMB traffic. This detection is important because it identifies potential SMB-based attacks, such as ransomware or data theft, which often involve a large number of SMB connections. This  suggests that an attacker is attempting to exfiltrate data or spread malware within the network. Next steps include investigating the source of the traffic and determining if it is malicious. This can involve reviewing network logs, capturing and analyzing any relevant network packets, and correlating with other security events to identify the attack source and mitigate the risk.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **smb_traffic_spike_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Traffic.dest_port
* All_Traffic.app
* All_Traffic.src



#### How To Implement
This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic logs and populating the `Network_Traffic` data model.
#### Known False Positives
A file server may experience high-demand loads that could cause this analytic to trigger.
