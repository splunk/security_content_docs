### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects the presence of SIGRed, a critical DNS vulnerability, using Zeek DNS and Zeek Conn data. SIGRed vulnerability allows attackers to run remote code on Windows DNS servers. By detecting SIGRed early, you can prevent further damage and protect the organization&#39;s network infrastructure. The detection is made by identifying specific DNS query types (SIG and KEY) in the Zeek DNS data and checks for high data transfer in the Zeek Conn data. If multiple instances of these indicators are found within a flow, it suggests the presence of SIGRed. The detection is important because it indicates a potential compromise of Windows DNS servers that suggests that an attacker might have gained unauthorized access to the DNS server and can run arbitrary code. The impact of this attack can be severe, leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or disruption of critical services. Next steps include investigating the affected flow and taking immediate action to mitigate the vulnerability. This can involve patching the affected DNS server, isolating the server from the network, or conducting a forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_windows_dns_sigred_via_zeek_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* DNS.query_type
* DNS.flow_id
* All_Traffic.bytes_in
* All_Traffic.flow_id



#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting Zeek DNS and Zeek Conn data into Splunk. Zeek data should also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting SIG and KEY records via bro:dns:json and TCP payload over 65KB in size via bro:conn:json.  The Network Resolution and Network Traffic datamodels are in use for this search.
#### Known False Positives
