### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

By enabling Dynamic ARP Inspection as a Layer 2 Security measure on the organization&#39;s network devices, we will be able to detect ARP Poisoning attacks in the Infrastructure.

#### Search

```
`cisco_networks` facility="PM" mnemonic="ERR_DISABLE" disable_cause="arp-inspection" 
| eval src_interface=src_int_prefix_long+src_int_suffix 
| stats min(_time) AS firstTime max(_time) AS lastTime count BY host src_interface 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
|`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
| `detect_arp_poisoning_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cisco_networks](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cisco_networks.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_arp_poisoning_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
This search uses a standard SPL query on logs from Cisco Network devices. The network devices must be configured with DHCP Snooping (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-0_2_EX/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg/b_sec_152ex_2960-x_cg_chapter_01101.html) and Dynamic ARP Inspection (see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst2960x/software/15-2_2_e/security/configuration_guide/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg/b_sec_1522e_2960x_cg_chapter_01111.html) and log with a severity level of minimum &#34;5 - notification&#34;. The search also requires that the Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467) is used to parse the logs from the Cisco network devices.
#### Known False Positives
This search might be prone to high false positives if DHCP Snooping or ARP inspection has been incorrectly configured, or if a device normally sends many ARP packets (unlikely).
