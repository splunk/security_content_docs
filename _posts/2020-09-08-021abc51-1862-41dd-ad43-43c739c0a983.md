### :no_entry: THIS IS A DEPRECATED DETECTION
This detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means that it will no longer be maintained or supported.

#### Description

Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker has gained control of the console by compromising an admin account, they can delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search will query the Change datamodel to detect users deleting network ACLs. Deprecated because it&#39;s a duplicate

#### Search

```
`cloudtrail` eventName=DeleteNetworkAcl
|rename userIdentity.arn as arn  
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(errorMessage) values(errorCode) values(userAgent) values(userIdentity.*) by src userName arn eventName 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)

> :information_source:
> **cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventName
* userIdentity.arn
* errorMessage
* errorCode
* userAgent
* src
* userName
* arn



#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter` macro.
#### Known False Positives
It&#39;s possible that a user has legitimately deleted a network ACL.
