### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Zerologon CVE-2020-1472 vulnerability through Zeek RPC. By detecting attempts to exploit the Zerologon vulnerability through Zeek RPC, SOC analysts can identify potential threats earlier and take appropriate action to mitigate the risks. This detection is made by a Splunk query that looks for specific Zeek RPC operations, including NetrServerPasswordSet2, NetrServerReqChallenge, and NetrServerAuthenticate3, which are aggregated by source and destination IP address and time. This detection is important because it suggests that an attacker is attempting to exploit the Zerologon vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the domain controller. Zerologon vulnerability is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to take over domain controllers without authentication, leading to a complete takeover of an organization&#39;s IT infrastructure. The impact of such an attack can be severe, potentially leading to data theft, ransomware, or other devastating outcomes. False positives might occur since legitimate Zeek RPC activity can trigger the analytic. Next steps include reviewing the identified source and destination IP addresses and the specific RPC operations used. Capture and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts, and review concurrent processes to identify the attack source upon triage .

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [zeek_rpc](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/zeek_rpc.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_zerologon_via_zeek_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting Zeek DCE-RPC data into Splunk. Zeek data should also be getting ingested in JSON format.  We are detecting when all three RPC operations (NetrServerReqChallenge, NetrServerAuthenticate3, NetrServerPasswordSet2) are splunk_security_essentials_app via bro:rpc:json.  These three operations are then correlated on the Zeek UID field.
