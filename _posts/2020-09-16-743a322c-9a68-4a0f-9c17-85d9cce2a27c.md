#### Description

The following analytic detects the creation or deletion of hidden shares using the net.exe command for prompt response and mitigation to enhance the overall security posture of the organization and protect against potential data breaches, malware infections, and other damaging outcomes. This detection is made by searching for processes that involve the use of net.exe and filters for actions related to creation or deletion of shares. This detection is important because it suggests that an attacker is attempting to manipulate or exploit the network by creating or deleting hidden shares. The creation or deletion of hidden shares can indicate malicious activity since attackers might use hidden shares to exfiltrate data, distribute malware, or establish persistence within a network. The impact of such an attack can vary, but it often involves unauthorized access to sensitive information, disruption of services, or the introduction of malware. False positives might occur since legitimate actions can also involve the use of net.exe. An extensive triage and investigation is necessary to determine the intent and nature of the detected activity. Next steps include reviewing the details of the process involving the net.exe command, including the user, parent process, and timestamps during the triage. Additionally, capture and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts and review concurrent processes to identify the source of the attack.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [process_net](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_net.yml)

> :information_source:
> **create_or_delete_windows_shares_using_net_exe_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators often leverage net.exe to create or delete network shares. You should verify that the activity was intentional and is legitimate.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$ enumerating Windows file shares. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
