### :no_entry: THIS IS A DEPRECATED DETECTION
This detection has been marked deprecated by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means that it will no longer be maintained or supported.

#### Description

This search looks for specific authentication events from the Windows Security Event logs to detect potential attempts at using the Pass-the-Hash technique. This search is DEPRECATED as it is possible for event code 4624 to generate a high level of noise, as legitimate logon events may also trigger this event code. This can be especially true in environments with high levels of user activity, such as those with many concurrent logons or frequent logon attempts.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_activity_related_to_pass_the_hash_attacks_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* Logon_Type
* Logon_Process
* WorkstationName
* user
* dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must ingest your Windows Security Event logs and leverage the latest TA for Windows.
#### Known False Positives
Legitimate logon activity by authorized NTLM systems may be detected by this search. Please investigate as appropriate.

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | The following $EventCode$ occurred on $dest$ by $user$ with Logon Type 3, which may be indicative of the pass the hash technique. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
