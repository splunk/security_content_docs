#### Description

This analytic detects multiple failed login attempts in Office365 Azure Active Directory from a single source IP address. Specifically, it identifies scenarios where there are more than 10 unsuccessful login attempts within a short time frame. The detection leverages Office365 management activity logs, specifically the AzureActiveDirectoryStsLogon records from the AzureActiveDirectory workload. It aggregates these logs in 5-minute intervals to count the number of failed login attempts and associates them with the originating source IP address. Multiple failed login attempts from a single source can be indicative of brute-force attacks, password spraying, or other malicious authentication attempts. Identifying and responding to these patterns promptly can prevent unauthorized access and potential breaches. If this detection represents a true positive, an attacker might be attempting to gain unauthorized access to an Office365 account. Successful compromise could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential lateral movement within the organization, or further malicious activities using the compromised account.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)

> :information_source:
> **high_number_of_login_failures_from_a_single_source_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Operation
* record_type
* app
* user
* LogonError
* authentication_method
* signature
* UserAgent
* src_ip
* record_type



#### How To Implement
You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. Adjust the threshold value to suit the specific environment, as environments with naturally higher login failures might generate false positives at a lower threshold.
#### Known False Positives
An Ip address with more than 10 failed authentication attempts in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | Ip address $src_ip$ failed to authenticate more than 10 times in a 5 minute |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
