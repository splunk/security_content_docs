### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects the presence of the Supernova webshell, which was used in the SUNBURST attack. This webshell can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a compromised system and run arbitrary code. This detection is made by a Splunk query that searches for specific patterns in web URLs, including &#34;*logoimagehandler.ashx*codes*&#34;, &#34;*logoimagehandler.ashx*clazz*&#34;, &#34;*logoimagehandler.ashx*method*&#34;, and &#34;*logoimagehandler.ashx*args*&#34;. These patterns are commonly used by the Supernova webshell to communicate with its command and control server. This detection is important because it indicates a potential compromise and unauthorized access to the system to run arbitrary code, which can lead to data theft, ransomware, or other damaging outcomes. False positives might occur since the patterns used by the webshell can also be present in legitimate web traffic. In such cases, tune the search to the specific environment and monitor it closely for any suspicious activity. Next steps include reviewing the web URLs and inspecting any relevant on-disk artifacts. Additionally, review concurrent processes and network connections to identify the source of the attack.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Web.Web where web.url=*logoimagehandler.ashx*codes* OR Web.url=*logoimagehandler.ashx*clazz* OR Web.url=*logoimagehandler.ashx*method* OR Web.url=*logoimagehandler.ashx*args* by Web.src Web.dest Web.url Web.vendor_product Web.user Web.http_user_agent _time span=1s 
| `supernova_webshell_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **supernova_webshell_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.url
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* Web.vendor_product
* Web.user
* Web.http_user_agent



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be monitoring web traffic to your Solarwinds Orion. The logs should be ingested into splunk and populating/mapped to the Web data model.
#### Known False Positives
There might be false positives associted with this detection since items like args as a web argument is pretty generic.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | tbd |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
