#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [linux_hosts](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/linux_hosts.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_baron_samedit_cve-2021-3156_segfault_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* host



#### How To Implement
Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than 5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a single host
#### Known False Positives
If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will pick those up too.
