#### Description

The following analytic detects the use of two specific tools, wmic and Powershell, to create a shadow copy to identify potential threats earlier and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks. This detection is made by a Splunk query that searches for processes in the Endpoint.Processes data model where either the process name contains &#34;wmic&#34; or &#34;Powershell&#34; and the process command contains &#34;shadowcopy&#34; and &#34;create&#34;. This detection is important because it suggests that an attacker is attempting to manipulate or access data in an unauthorized manner, which can lead to data theft, data manipulation, or other malicious activities. Attackers might use shadow copies to backup and exfiltrate sensitive data or to hide their tracks by restoring files to a previous state after an attack. Next steps include reviewing the user associated with the process, the process name, the original file name, the process command, and the destination of the process. Additionally, examine any relevant on-disk artifacts and review other concurrent processes to determine the source of the attack.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [process_wmic](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_wmic.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [process_powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_powershell.yml)

> :information_source:
> **creation_of_shadow_copy_with_wmic_and_powershell_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
