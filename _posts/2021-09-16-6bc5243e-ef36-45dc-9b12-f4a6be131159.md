#### Description

The following analytic detects whether a process is attempting to add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store, which might result in security tools being disabled. The detection is made by focusing on process activities and command-line arguments that are related to the &#39;certutil -addstore&#39; command. This detection is important because it helps to identify attackers who might add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store to disable security tools and gain unauthorized access to a system. False positives might occur since legitimate reasons might exist for a process to add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store, such as system administration tasks. Next steps include conducting an extensive triage and investigation prior to taking any action. Additionally, you must understand the importance of trust and its subversion in system security.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [process_certutil](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_certutil.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **attempt_to_add_certificate_to_untrusted_store_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
There may be legitimate reasons for administrators to add a certificate to the untrusted certificate store. In such cases, this will typically be done on a large number of systems.

> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
