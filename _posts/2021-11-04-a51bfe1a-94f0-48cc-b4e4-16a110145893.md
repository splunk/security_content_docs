#### Description

The following analytic aims to identify the use of tools commonly exploited by cybercriminals. The use of these tools often signals nefarious activities like unauthorized access, network scanning, or data exfiltration, representing a significant threat to an organization&#39;s security infrastructure. By examining process activity on the host, particularly those processes corresponding to known attacker tool names, this analytic serves as an early warning system for potential security incidents. However, its precision must be balanced with the understanding that some administrative activities might also trigger alerts, resulting in false positives. This underlines the importance of cyber analysts having a clear understanding of typical endpoint activities and behaviors within their organization, enabling them to accurately interpret and respond to these alerts.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **attacker_tools_on_endpoint_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [attacker_tools](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.parent_process



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the processes node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is usually generated via logs that report process tracking in your Windows audit settings.
#### Known False Positives
Some administrator activity can be potentially triggered, please add those users to the filter macro.

> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
