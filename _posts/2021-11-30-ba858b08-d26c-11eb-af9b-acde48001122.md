#### Description

This analytic will identify a suspicious command-line that disables a user account using the native `net.exe` or `net1.exe` utility to Windows. This technique may used by the adversaries to interrupt availability of accounts and continue the impact against the organization.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **disable_net_user_account_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* process.pid
* process.file.path
* process.file.name
* process.cmd_line
* actor.user.name
* actor.process.pid
* actor.process.file.path
* actor.process.file.name
* device.hostname



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe/net1.exe may be used.
#### Known False Positives
System administrators or automated scripts may disable an account but not a common practice. Filter as needed.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified on endpoint $dest_device_id$ by user $dest_user_id$ attempting to disable accounts. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
