#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect suspicious file creation within the systemd timer directory on Linux platforms. Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, similar to the combination of wininit.exe and services.exe on Windows. This process initializes a Linux system and starts defined services in unit files. Malicious actors, such as adversaries, malware, or red teamers, can exploit this feature by embedding a systemd service file for persistence on the targeted or compromised host.\
The analytic works by monitoring logs with file name, file path, and process GUID data from your endpoints. If a .service file is created in certain systemd directories, the analytic triggers an alert. This behavior is significant for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it may indicate a persistent threat within the network, with a potential impact of system compromise or data exfiltration.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name = *.service Filesystem.file_path IN ("*/etc/systemd/system*", "*/lib/systemd/system*", "*/usr/lib/systemd/system*", "*/run/systemd/system*", "*~/.config/systemd/*", "*~/.local/share/systemd/*","*/etc/systemd/user*", "*/lib/systemd/user*", "*/usr/lib/systemd/user*", "*/run/systemd/user*") by Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.file_path 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `linux_service_file_created_in_systemd_directory_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **linux_service_file_created_in_systemd_directory_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Filesystem.dest
* Filesystem.file_create_time
* Filesystem.file_name
* Filesystem.process_guid
* Filesystem.file_path



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the file name, file path, and process_guid executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may arise when administrators or network operators create files in systemd directories for legitimate automation tasks. Therefore, it&#39;s important to adjust filter macros to account for valid activities. To implement this search successfully, it&#39;s crucial to ingest appropriate logs, preferably using the Linux Sysmon Add-on from Splunkbase for those using Sysmon.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | A service file named as $file_path$ is created in systemd folder on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
