### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This detection rule monitors for the creation of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access keys. An IAM access key consists of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests to AWS services. While IAM access keys can be legitimately used by developers and administrators for API access, their creation can also be indicative of malicious activity. Attackers who have gained unauthorized access to an AWS environment might create access keys as a means to establish persistence or to exfiltrate data through the APIs. Moreover, because access keys can be used to authenticate with AWS services without the need for further interaction, they can be particularly appealing for bad actors looking to operate under the radar. Consequently, it&#39;s important to vigilantly monitor and scrutinize access key creation events, especially if they are associated with unusual activity or are created by users who don&#39;t typically perform these actions. This hunting query identifies when a potentially compromised user creates a IAM access key for another user who may have higher privilleges, which can be a sign for privilege escalation. Hunting queries are designed to be executed manual during threat hunting.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [amazon_security_lake](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/amazon_security_lake.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **asl_aws_createaccesskey_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* api.service.name
* api.operation
* identity.user.account_uid
* identity.user.credential_uid
* identity.user.name
* identity.user.type
* identity.user.uid
* identity.user.uuid
* http_request.user_agent
* src_endpoint.ip
* unmapped{}.key
* unmapped{}.value



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format.
#### Known False Positives
While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 70 | 90 | User $responseElements.accessKey.userName$ is attempting to create access keys for $responseElements.accessKey.userName$ from this IP $src_endpoint.ip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
