#### Description

On Splunk version 9 on Python3 client libraries verify server certificates by default and use CA certificate store. This search warns a user about a failure to validate a certificate using python3 request.

#### Search

```
`splunk_python` "simpleRequest SSL certificate validation is enabled without hostname verification" 
| stats count by host path 
| `splunk_protocol_impersonation_weak_encryption_simplerequest_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunk_python](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunk_python.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_protocol_impersonation_weak_encryption_simplerequest_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* host
* event_message
* path



#### How To Implement
Must upgrade to Splunk version 9 and Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk Python modules in order to apply this search. Splunk SOAR customers can find a SOAR workbook that walks an analyst through the process of running these hunting searches in the references list of this detection. In order to use this workbook, a user will need to run a curl command to post the file to their SOAR instance such as &#34;curl -u username:password https://soar.instance.name/rest/rest/workbook_template -d @splunk_psa_0622.json&#34;. A user should then create an empty container or case, attach the workbook, and begin working through the tasks.
#### Known False Positives
This search tries to address validation of server and client certificates within Splunk infrastructure, it might produce results from accidental or unintended requests to port 8089.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 40.0 | 50 | 80 | Failed to validate certificate on $host$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
