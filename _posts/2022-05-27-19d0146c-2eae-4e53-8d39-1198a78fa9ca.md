#### Description

This detection utilizes machine learning model named &#34;risky_command_abuse&#34; trained from &#34;Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky SPL MLTK Baseline&#34;. It should be scheduled to run hourly to detect whether a user has run searches containing risky SPL from this list https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards#Commands_that_trigger_the_warninga with abnormally long running time in the past one hour, comparing with his/her past seven days history. This search uses the trained baseline to infer whether a search is an outlier (isOutlier ~= 1.0) or not (isOutlier~= 0.0)

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **splunk_command_and_scripting_interpreter_risky_spl_mltk_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Search_Activity.search
* Search_Activity.total_run_time
* Search_Activity.user
* Search_Activity.search_type



#### How To Implement
This detection depends on MLTK app which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/ and the Splunk Audit datamodel which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/. Baseline model needs to be built using &#34;Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky SPL MLTK Baseline&#34; before this search can run. Please note that the current search only finds matches exactly one space between separator bar and risky commands.
#### Known False Positives
If the run time of a search exceeds the boundaries of outlier defined by the fitted density function model, false positives can occur, incorrectly labeling a long running search as potentially risky.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 20.0 | 50 | 40 | Abnormally long run time for risk SPL command seen by user $(Search_Activity.user). |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
