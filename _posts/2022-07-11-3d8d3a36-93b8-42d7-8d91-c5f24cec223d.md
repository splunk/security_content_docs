#### Description

The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple valid users. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Azure Active Directory tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. Error Code 50126 represents an invalid password.\
The detection calculates the standard deviation for source Ip and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of failed authentication attempts. To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\
While looking for anomalies using statistical methods like the standard deviation can have benefits, we also recommend using threshold-based detections to complement coverage. A similar analytic following the threshold model is `Azure AD Multiple Users Failing To Authenticate From Ip`.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* properties.status.errorCode
* category
* properties.authenticationDetails
* properties.userPrincipalName
* properties.ipAddress



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
#### Known False Positives
A source Ip failing to authenticate with multiple users is not a common for legitimate behavior.
