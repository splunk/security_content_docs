#### Description

This analytic identifies `StopLogging` events in CloudTrail logs. Adversaries often try to impair their target&#39;s defenses by stopping their macliious activity from being logged, so that they may operate with stealth and avoid detection. When the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment, they may easily stop logging.
