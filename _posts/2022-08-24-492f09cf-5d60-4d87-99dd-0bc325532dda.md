#### Description

The following analytic identifies a process in a non-standard file path on Windows attempting to create a remote thread into a process. This Windows API,CreateRemoteThread, is commonly used by adversaries for process injection to evade detections or gain privilege escalation.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage = "*.exe" AND NOT(SourceImage IN("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "%systemroot%\\*")) 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage signature TargetProcessGuid SourceProcessGuid TargetProcessId SourceProcessId StartAddress EventCode dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_process_injection_with_public_source_path_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_process_injection_with_public_source_path_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* SourceImage
* TargetImage
* TargetProcessId
* SourceProcessId
* StartAddress
* EventCode
* dest
* signature
* TargetProcessGuid
* SourceProcessGuid
* StartAddress



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
Some security products or third party applications may utilize CreateRemoteThread, filter as needed before enabling as a notable.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | process $SourceImage$ create a remote thread to process $TargetImage$ on host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
