#### Description

The following analytic identifies the decompile parameter with the HTML Help application, HH.exe. This is a uncommon command to see ran and behavior. Most recently this was seen in a APT41 campaign where a CHM file was delivered and a script inside used a technique for running an arbitrary command in a CHM file via an ActiveX object. This unpacks an HTML help file to a specified path for launching the next stage.

#### Search

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **windows_system_binary_proxy_execution_compiled_html_file_decompile_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* process.pid
* process.file.path
* process.file.name
* process.cmd_line
* actor.user.name
* actor.process.pid
* actor.process.file.path
* actor.process.file.name
* device.hostname



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited, filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 100 | 90 | $process_name$ has been identified using decompile against a CHM on $dest_device_id$ under user $dest_user_id$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
