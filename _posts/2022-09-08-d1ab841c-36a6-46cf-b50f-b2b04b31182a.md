#### Description

Aside from being used to promote genuine domain controllers, the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) account can be used to persist within a Domain. A DC can be configured to allow the DSRM account to logon &amp; be used in the same way as a local administrator account. This detection is looking for any password reset attempts against that account.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_dsrm_password_reset_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Changes.result_id
* All_Changes.result
* All_Changes.action
* All_Changes.dest
* All_Changes.src
* All_Changes.user



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode `4794` and  have the Advanced Security Audit policy `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` enabled.
#### Known False Positives
Resetting the DSRM password for legitamate reasons, i.e. forgot the password. Disaster recovery. Deploying AD backdoor deliberately.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | DSRM Account Password was reset on $dest$ by $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
