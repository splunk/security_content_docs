#### Description

The following hunting analytic identifies EventCode 3000 in Application channel indicating a process exit. This behavior is based on process names being added to the Image File Execution Options under HKLM \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\ and \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit. Once these are set for a process, an eventcode 3000 will generate. The example used is from Thinkst Canary where a CanaryToken is setup to monitor for a commonly abused living off the land binary (ex. Klist.exe) and generate an event when it occurs. This can be seen as settings traps to monitor for suspicious behavior. Monitor and tune this hunting analytic and setup traps across your organization and begin monitoring.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_application](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_application.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_event_triggered_image_file_execution_options_injection_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Process
* Exit_Code
* dest
* EventCode



#### How To Implement
This analytic requires capturing the Windows Event Log Application channel in XML.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present and tuning will be required before turning into a TTP or notable.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | Windows eventcode 3000 triggered on $dest$ potentially indicating persistence or a monitoring of a process has occurred. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
