#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **living_off_the_land_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Risk.analyticstories
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic
* source



#### How To Implement
To implement this correlation search a user needs to enable all detections in the Living Off The Land Analytic Story and confirm it is generating risk events. A simple search `index=risk analyticstories=&#34;Living Off The Land&#34;` should contain events.
#### Known False Positives
There are no known false positive for this search, but it could contain false positives as multiple detections can trigger and not have successful exploitation. Modify the static value distinct_detection_name to a higher value. It is also required to tune analytics that are also tagged to ensure volume is never too much.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 90 | 70 | An increase of Living Off The Land behavior has been detected on $affected_systems$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
