#### Description

The following analytic identifies the odbcconf.exe, Windows Open Database Connectivity utility, loading up a resource file. The file extension is arbitrary and may be named anything. The resource file itself may have different commands supported by Odbcconf to load up a DLL (REGSVR) on disk or additional commands. During triage, review file modifications and parallel processes.

#### Search

```
 $main = from source  
| eval timestamp = time  
| eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  
| eval process_pid = process.pid 
| eval process_file = process.file 
| eval process_file_path = process_file.path 
| eval process_file_name = process_file.name 
| eval process_cmd_line = process.cmd_line 
| eval actor_user = actor.user 
| eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **windows_odbcconf_load_response_file_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* process.pid
* process.file.path
* process.file.name
* process.cmd_line
* actor.user.name
* actor.process.pid
* actor.process.file.path
* actor.process.file.name
* device.hostname



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present and filtering may need to occur based on legitimate application usage. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 60 | 70 | $process_name$ has been identified on $dest_device_id$ under user $dest_user_id$ attempting to circumvent controls. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
