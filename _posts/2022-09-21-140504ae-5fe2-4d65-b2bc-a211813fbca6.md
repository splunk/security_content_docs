### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

The following anomaly relies on the Okta ThreatInsight identification of a threat. Use this to drive risk up by src_ip or add additional fields to track. Identification may include password spraying, login failures and Login failures with high unknown users count.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_threatinsight_threat_detected_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* signature
* eventType
* displayMessage
* client.device
* city
* state
* country
* user_agent
* outcome.reason
* outcome.result
* severity



#### How To Implement
This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | The following $src_ip$ has been conisidered a threat by Okta ThreatInsight. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
