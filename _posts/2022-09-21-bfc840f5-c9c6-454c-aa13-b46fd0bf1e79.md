#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_suspicious_activity_reported_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* displayMessage
* user
* eventType
* client.userAgent.rawUserAgent
* client.userAgent.browser
* client.geographicalContext.city
* client.geographicalContext.country



#### How To Implement
This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested. It also requires that suspicious activity reporting is enabled and associates are trained to submit.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited as this is a high fidelity marker.
