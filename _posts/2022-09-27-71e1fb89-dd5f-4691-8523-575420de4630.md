#### Description

The following analytic identifies one source Ip failing to authenticate into the AWS Console with 30 unique valid users within 10 minutes. This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an AWS environment tenant to obtain initial access or elevate privileges.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud

#### Search

```
`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure 
| bucket span=10m _time 
| stats  dc(user_name) AS unique_accounts values(user_name) as tried_accounts by _time, src_ip, eventName, action, user_agent 
|  where unique_accounts > 30 
|`aws_unusual_number_of_failed_authentications_from_ip_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_multiple_users_failing_to_authenticate_from_ip_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* user
* action
* eventName
* src_ip



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk Add-on for AWS in order to ingest Cloudtrail. We recommend the users to try different combinations of the bucket span time and the tried account threshold to tune this search according to their environment.
#### Known False Positives
No known false postives for this detection. Please review this alert

* [Compromised User Account](/stories/compromised_user_account)




#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 54.0 | 60 | 90 | Multiple failed console login attempts against users $tried_accounts$ seen from $src_ip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
