#### Description

The following correlation will take risk associated with the content from  &#34;Suspicious Okta Activity&#34; and &#34;Okta MFA Exhaustion&#34; analytic stories and tally it up. Once it hits the threshold of 100 (may be changed), it will trigger an anomaly. As needed, reduce or raise the risk scores assocaited with the anomaly and TTP analytics tagged to these two stories.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_risk_threshold_exceeded_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.analyticstories



#### How To Implement
Ensure &#34;Suspicious Okta Activity&#34; and &#34;Okta MFA Exhaustion&#34; analytic stories are enabled. TTP may be set to Notables for point detections, anomaly should not be notables but risk generators. The correlation relies on risk before generating a notable. Modify the value as needed. Default threshold is 100. This value may need to be increased based on activity in your environment.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will be limited to the amount of events generated by the analytics tied to the stories. Analytics will need to be tesetd and tuned, risk score reduced, as needed based on organization.

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Suspicious Okta Activity](/stories/suspicious_okta_activity)
* [Okta MFA Exhaustion](/stories/okta_mfa_exhaustion)




#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 70 | 80 | Risk threshold exceeded for $risk_object_type$=$risk_object$ related to Okta events. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
