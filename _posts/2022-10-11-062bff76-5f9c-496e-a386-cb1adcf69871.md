#### Search

```
`splunkd_webx` uri=/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model* uri_query!=null 
| stats count by _time host status clientip user uri 
| `splunk_stored_xss_via_data_model_objectname_field_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunkd_webx](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_webx.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_stored_xss_via_data_model_objectname_field_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* uri
* uri_query
* host
* status
* clientip
* user
* uri_path



#### How To Implement
This vulnerability only affects Splunk Web enabled instances. This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index.
#### Known False Positives
This search may produce false positives and does not cover exploitation attempts via code obfuscation, focus of search is suspicious requests against &#34;/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model&#34; which is the injection point.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A potential XSS attempt has been detected from $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
