#### Search

```
`splunkd_webx` method=POST  uri=/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model 
| table _time host status clientip user uri 
| `splunk_xss_in_save_table_dialog_header_in_search_page_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunkd_webx](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_webx.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_xss_in_save_table_dialog_header_in_search_page_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* host
* _time
* status
* clientip
* user
* uri
* method



#### How To Implement
Watch for POST requests combined with XSS script strings or obfuscation against the injection point /en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model.
#### Known False Positives
If host is vulnerable and XSS script strings are inputted they will show up in search. Not all Post requests are malicious as they will show when users create and save dashboards. This search may produce several results with non malicious POST requests. Only affects Splunk Web enabled instances.
