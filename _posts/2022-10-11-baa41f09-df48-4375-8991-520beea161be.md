#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* uri_path
* clientip
* file
* host
* method
* sort



#### How To Implement
This search only applies if Splunk Mobile Gateway is deployed in the vulnerable Splunk versions.
#### Known False Positives
This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. Focus of this search is &#34;uri_path=/servicesNS/nobody/splunk_secure_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile_alerts*&#34; which is the injection point.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 81.0 | 90 | 90 | Possible exploitation attempt from $clientip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
