#### Description

The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication requests for a single user within a Google Cloud Platform tenant. Specifically, the analytic triggers when 10 or more MFA user prompts fail within 5 minutes. Google CLoud tenants can be very different depending on the organization, Security teams should test this detection and customize these arbitrary thresholds. The detected behavior may represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials for a user and continuously repeats login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request. Threat actors like the Lapsus team and APT29 have leveraged this technique to bypass multi-factor authentication controls as reported by Mandiant and others.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [gws_reports_login](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/gws_reports_login.yml)
* [gws_login_mfa_methods](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/gws_login_mfa_methods.yml)

> :information_source:
> **gcp_multiple_failed_mfa_requests_for_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Google Workspace from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5556) which allows Splunk administrators to collect Google Workspace event data in Splunk using Google Workspace APIs. We would also recommend tuning the detection by adjusting the window `span` and `mfa_prompts` threshold values according to your environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the User log events.
#### Known False Positives
Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication or application issues. Filter as needed.
