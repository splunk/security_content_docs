#### Description

The following analytic identifies the usage of mshta.exe Windows binary in registry to execute malicious script. This technique was seen in kovter malware where it create several registry entry which is a encoded javascript and will be executed by another registry containing mshta and javascript activexobject to execute the encoded script using wscript.shell. This TTP is a good indication of kovter malware or other adversaries or threat actors leveraging fileless detection that survive system reboot.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_mshta_execution_in_registry_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Registry.registry_key_name
* Registry.registry_path
* Registry.dest
* Registry.registry_value_data
* Registry.action



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to the registry.
#### Known False Positives
unknown

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 72.0 | 80 | 90 | A registry $registry_path$ contains mshta $registry_value_data$ in $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
