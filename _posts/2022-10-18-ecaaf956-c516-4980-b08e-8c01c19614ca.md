#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **windows_rename_system_utilities_adplus_exe_lolbas_in_non_standard_path_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* process.pid
* process.file.path
* process.file.name
* process.cmd_line
* actor.user.name
* actor.process.pid
* actor.process.file.path
* actor.process.file.name
* device.hostname



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting logs with the process name, command-line arguments, and parent processes from your endpoints. Collect endpoint data such as Sysmon or Windows Events 4688.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present and filtering may be required. Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application in use.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 14.0 | 20 | 70 | A system process $process_name$ with path $process_path$ spawn in non-default folder path on host $dest_device_id$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
