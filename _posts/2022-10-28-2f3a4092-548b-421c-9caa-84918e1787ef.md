#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious wermgr.exe process creating or connecting to a named pipe. Wermgr.exe is part of Windows OS Problem reporting application responsible for reporting problems, fault or error happen on the Windows OS. This file is being abused by several Threat actors and malware such as Trickbot and Qakbot to execute their malicious code. This anomaly detection can be a good pivot on possible wermgr.exe processes having injected malicious code that might be related to qakbot infection that communicates via named pipe.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_app_layer_protocol_wermgr_connect_to_namedpipe_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Image
* EventType
* ProcessGuid
* ProcessId
* PipeName
* Computer
* UserID
* SecurityID



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | wermgr.exe process is creating or connecting to a named pipe $PipeName$ in $Computer$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
