#### Description

This analytic identifies the suspicious Remote Thread execution of wermgr.exe process to &#34;firefox.exe&#34;, &#34;chrome.exe&#34; and other known browsers. This technique was seen in Qakbot malware that executes its malicious code by injecting its code in legitimate Windows Operating System processes such as wermgr.exe to steal information in the compromised host. This TTP detection can be a good pivot to detect wermgr.exe process injected with qakbot code that tries to remote thread code execution in known browsers like firefox and edge which is not a common behavior of this wermgr.exe application.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=8 SourceImage = "*\\wermgr.exe" TargetImage IN ("*\\firefox.exe", "*\\chrome.exe", "*\\iexplore.exe","*\\microsoftedgecp.exe") 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage SourceProcessGuid SourceProcessId StartAddress StartFunction TargetProcessGuid TargetProcessId  EventCode dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_process_injection_of_wermgr_to_known_browser_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_process_injection_of_wermgr_to_known_browser_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* SourceImage
* TargetImage
* SourceProcessGuid
* SourceProcessId
* StartAddress
* StartFunction
* TargetProcessGuid
* TargetProcessId
* EventCode
* dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the SourceImage, TargetImage, and EventCode executions from your endpoints related to create remote thread or injecting codes. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
unknown

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | wermgr.exe process $SourceImage$ create a remote thread to a browser process $TargetImage$ in host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
