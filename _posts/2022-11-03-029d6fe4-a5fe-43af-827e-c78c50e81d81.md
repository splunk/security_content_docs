### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

The following analytic utilizes the Zeek x509 log. Modify the zeek_x509 macro with your index and sourcetype as needed. You will need to ensure the full x509 is logged as the potentially malicious punycode is nested under subject alternative names. In this particular analytic, it will identify punycode within the subject alternative name email and other fields. Note, that OtherFields is meant to be BOOL (true,false), therefore we may never see xn-- in that field. Upon identifying punycode, manually copy and paste, or add CyberChef recipe to query, and decode the punycode manually.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [zeek_x509](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/zeek_x509.yml)

> :information_source:
> **zeek_x509_certificate_with_punycode_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

* domain_detected
* basic_constraints.ca

#### How To Implement
The following analytic requires x509 certificate data to be logged entirely. In particular, for CVE-2022-3602, the punycode will be within the leaf certificate. The analytic may be modified to look for all xn--, or utilize a network IDS/monitoring tool like Zeek or Suricata to drill down into cert captured. Note for Suricata, the certificate is base64 encoded and will need to be decoded to capture the punycode (punycode will need to be decoded after).
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present if the organization works with international businesses. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 15.0 | 50 | 30 | A x509 certificate has been identified to have punycode in the subject alternative name on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
