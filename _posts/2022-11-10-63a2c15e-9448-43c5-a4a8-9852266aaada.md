#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious process creating or connecting to a possible Qakbot named pipe . This technique was seen in Qakbot malware that creates named pipe after injecting its code in legitimate process to communicate on other process that also has an injected code to steal information on the compromised host. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot for possible Qakbot infection. This detection looks for possible random generated named pipe (in GUID form) created by known process being abused by Qakbot.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_app_layer_protocol_qakbot_namedpipe_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Image
* EventType
* ProcessGuid
* ProcessId
* PipeName
* dest
* UserID
* SecurityID



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, pipename, processguid and named pipe event type from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | $Image$ is creating or connecting to a named pipe $PipeName$ in $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
