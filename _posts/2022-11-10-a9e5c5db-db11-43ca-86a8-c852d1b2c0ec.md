#### Description

The following analytic detects Searches for file modifications that commonly occur with Ransomware to detect modifications to files with extensions that are commonly used by Ransomware. The detection is made by searches for changes in the datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem, specifically modifications to file extensions that match those commonly used by Ransomware. The detection is important because it suggests that an attacker is attempting to encrypt or otherwise modify files in the environment using malware, potentially leading to data loss that can cause significant damage to an organization&#39;s data and systems. False positives might occur so the SOC must investigate the affected system to determine the source of the modification and take appropriate action to contain and remediate the attack.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [ransomware_extensions](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/ransomware_extensions.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **common_ransomware_extensions_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Filesystem.user
* Filesystem.dest
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.file_name



#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Filesystem data model node. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, please review the detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`
#### Known False Positives
It is possible for a legitimate file with these extensions to be created. If this is a true ransomware attack, there will be a large number of files created with these extensions.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 90 | 100 | The device $dest$ wrote $file_count$ files to $path_count$ path(s) with the $file_extension$ extension. This extension and behavior may indicate a $Name$ ransomware attack. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
