```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_detect_users_with_kms_keys_performing_encryption_s3_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventName
* requestParameters.x-amz-server-side-encryption
* requestParameters.bucketName
* requestParameters.x-amz-copy-source
* requestParameters.key
* userAgent
* region



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
#### Known False Positives
There maybe buckets provisioned with S3 encryption

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 15.0 | 30 | 50 | User $user$ with KMS keys is performing encryption, against S3 buckets on these files $dest_file$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
