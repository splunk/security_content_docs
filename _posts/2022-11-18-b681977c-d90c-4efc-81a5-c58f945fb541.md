#### Description

The following analytic identifies the addition of a Service Principal Name to a domain account that is quickly deleted within 5 minutes or less. While this event may be part of a legitimate action part of certain administrative operations, it may also be evidence of a persistence attack. Domain accounts with Service Principal Names are vulnerable to a technique called Kerberoasting that enables attackers to potentially obtain the cleartext password of the account by performing offline cracking. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to a domain environment may add an SPN to a privileged account to then leverage the Kerberoasting technique and attempt to obtain its clertext password. To clean things up, the adversary may delete the SPN which will trigger this detection.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_short_lived_domain_account_serviceprincipalname_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ObjectDN
* signature
* SubjectUserName
* Computer



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
#### Known False Positives
A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account when an application requires it. Adding an SPN and quickly deleting it is less common but may be part of legitimate action. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 40.0 | 50 | 80 | A Servince Principal Name for $user$ was set and shortly deleted |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
