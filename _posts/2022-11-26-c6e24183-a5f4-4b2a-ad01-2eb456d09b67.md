### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This search looks for evidence of Active Directory replication traffic [MS-DRSR] from unexpected sources. This traffic is often seen exclusively between Domain Controllers for AD database replication. Any detections from non-domain controller source to a domain controller may indicate the usage of DCSync or DCShadow credential dumping techniques.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_replication_service_traffic_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* All_Traffic.src
* All_Traffic.dest
* All_Traffic.app



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting application aware firewall or proxy logs into the Network Datamodel. Categorize all known domain controller Assets servers with an appropriate category for filtering.
#### Known False Positives
New domain controllers or certian scripts run by administrators.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | Active Directory Replication Traffic from Unknown Source - $src$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
