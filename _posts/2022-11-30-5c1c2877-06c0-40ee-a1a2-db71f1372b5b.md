#### Description

The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves information related to private keys files. This technique was seen in several post exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige to search for private key certificates on the compromised host for insecurely stored credentials. This files can be used by adversaries to gain privileges, persistence or remote service authentication to collect more sensitive information. Some private keys required password for operation, so in this case adversaries may need to have that passphrase either via keylogging or brute force attack.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*dir *" OR  Processes.process = "*findstr*" AND Processes.process IN ( "*.rdg*", "*.gpg*", "*.pgp*", "*.p12*", "*.der*", "*.csr*", "*.cer*", "*.ovpn*", "*.key*",  "*.ppk*", "*.p12*", "*.pem*", "*.pfx*", "*.p7b*", "*.asc*") by Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user

| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_private_keys_discovery_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_private_keys_discovery_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.parent_process_guid
* Processes.process_guid



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
#### Known False Positives

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | a process with commandline $process$ that can retrieve information related to private keys in $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
