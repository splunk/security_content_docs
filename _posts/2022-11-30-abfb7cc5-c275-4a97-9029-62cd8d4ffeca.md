#### Description

The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS built-in tool netsh.exe to show state, configuration and profile of host firewall. This tool is being used or abused by several adversaries or even post exploitation tool to bypass firewall rules or to discover firewall settings. This hunting detection can help to detect a possible suspicious usage of netsh.exe to retrieve firewall settings or even firewall wlan profile. We recommend checking which parent process and process name execute this command. Also check the process file path for verification that may lead to further TTP&#39;s threat behavior.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [process_netsh](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_netsh.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_system_network_connections_discovery_netsh_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.parent_process_guid
* Processes.process_guid



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 9.0 | 30 | 30 | netsh process with command line $process$ in $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
