### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic uses a pre trained deep learning model to detect suspicious DNS TXT records. The model is trained independently and is then made available for download. The DNS TXT records are categorized into commonly identified types like email, verification, http using regular expressions https://www.tide-project.nl/blog/wtmc2020/. The TXT records that do not match regular expressions for well known types are labeled as 1 for &#34;unknown/suspicious&#34; and otherwise 0 for &#34;not suspicious&#34;. The deep learning model we have developed uses DNS TXT responses to analyze patterns of character sequences to predict if a DNS TXT is suspicious or not. The higher the pred_is_unknown_proba, the more likely the DNS TXT record is suspicious. The threshold for flagging a domain as suspicious is set at 0.5.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
Steps to deploy detect suspicious DNS TXT records model into Splunk App DSDL. This detection depends on the Splunk app for Data Science and Deep Learning which can be found here - `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4607/` and the Network Resolution datamodel which can be found here - `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/`. The detection uses a pre-trained deep learning model that needs to be deployed in DSDL app. Follow the steps for deployment here - `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/How-to-deploy-pre-trained-Deep-Learning-models-for-ESCU`.\
* Download the `artifacts .tar.gz` file from the link - `https://seal.splunkresearch.com/detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz`.\
* Download the `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb` Jupyter notebook from `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/notebooks`.\
* Login to the Jupyter Lab assigned for  `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl` container. This container should be listed on Containers page for DSDL app.\
* Below steps need to be followed inside Jupyter lab.\
* Upload the `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz` file into `app/model/data` path using the upload option in the jupyter notebook.\
* Untar the artifact `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz` using `tar -xf app/model/data/detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz -C app/model/data`.\
* Upload detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb` into Jupyter lab notebooks folder using the upload option in Jupyter lab.\
* Save the notebook using the save option in Jupyter notebook.\
* Upload `detect_suspicious_dns_txt_records_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.json` into `notebooks/data` folder.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present if DNS TXT record contents are similar to benign DNS TXT record contents.
