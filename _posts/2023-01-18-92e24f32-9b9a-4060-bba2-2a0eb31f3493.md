### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic uses a pre trained deep learning model to detect Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) generated domains. The model is trained independently and is then made available for download. One of the prominent indicators of a domain being DGA generated is if the domain name consists of unusual character sequences or concatenated dictionary words. Adversaries often use clever techniques to obfuscate machine generated domain names as human generated. Predicting DGA generated domain names requires analysis and building a model based on carefully chosen features. The deep learning model we have developed uses the domain name to analyze patterns of character sequences along with carefully chosen custom features to predict if a domain is DGA generated. The model takes a domain name consisting of second-level and top-level domain names as input and outputs a dga_score. Higher the dga_score, the more likely the input domain is a DGA domain. The threshold for flagging a domain as DGA is set at 0.5.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_dga_domains_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
Steps to deploy DGA detection model into Splunk App DSDL.\ This detection depends on the Splunk app for Data Science and Deep Learning which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4607/ and the Network Resolution datamodel which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/. The detection uses a pre-trained deep learning model that needs to be deployed in DSDL app. Follow the steps for deployment here - https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/How-to-deploy-pre-trained-Deep-Learning-models-for-ESCU.\ * Download the artifacts .tar.gz file from the link  `https://seal.splunkresearch.com/pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.tar.gz`\
* Download the pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.ipynb Jupyter notebook from `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/notebooks`\
* Login to the Jupyter Lab for pretrained_dga_model_dsdl container. This container should be listed on Containers page for DSDL app.\
* Below steps need to be followed inside Jupyter lab \
* Upload the pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.tar.gz file into `app/model/data` path using the upload option in the jupyter notebook.\
*  Untar the artifact `pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.tar.gz` using `tar -xf app/model/data/pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.tar.gz -C app/model/data`\
* Upload `pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.pynb` into Jupyter lab notebooks folder using the upload option in Jupyter lab\
* Save the notebook using the save option in jupyter notebook.\
* Upload `pretrained_dga_model_dsdl.json` into `notebooks/data` folder.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present if domain name is similar to dga generated domains.
