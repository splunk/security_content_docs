#### Description

The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account with more than 20 failed authentication events in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent a brute force attack against the account. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azuread](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azuread.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* properties.status.errorCode
* category
* properties.authenticationDetails
* properties.userPrincipalName
* properties.ipAddress



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs log category.
#### Known False Positives
A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 50 | 70 | User $userPrincipalName$ failed to authenticate more than 20 times in the span of 5 minutes. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
