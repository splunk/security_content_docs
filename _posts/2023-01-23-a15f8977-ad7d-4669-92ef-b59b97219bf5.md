### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic uses a pre-trained Deep Learning model to predict whether a processname is suspicious or not. Malwares and malicious programs such as ransomware often use tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as copying malicious files to the local machine to propagate themselves across the network. A key indicator of compromise is that after a successful execution of the malware, it copies itself as an executable file with a randomly generated filename and places this file in one of the directories. Such techniques are seen in several malwares such as TrickBot. We develop machine learning model that uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to distinguish between malicious and benign processnames. The model is trained independently and is then made available for download. We use a character level RNN to classify malicious vs. benign processnames. The higher is_malicious_prob, the more likely is the processname to be suspicious (between [0,1]). The threshold for flagging a processname as suspicious is set as 0.5.

> :information_source:
> **detect_suspicious_processnames_using_a_pretrained_model_in_dsdl_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
Steps to deploy detect suspicious processnames model into Splunk App DSDL. This detection depends on the Splunk app for Data Science and Deep Learning which can be found here - `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4607/` and the Endpoint datamodel. The detection uses a pre-trained deep learning model that needs to be deployed in the DSDL app. Follow the steps for deployment here - `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/How-to-deploy-pre-trained-Deep-Learning-models-for-ESCU`.\
* Download the `artifacts .tar.gz` file from the link - `https://seal.splunkresearch.com/detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz`.\
* Download the `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb` Jupyter notebook from the link - `https://github.com/splunk/security_content/notebooks`.\
* Login to the Jupyter Lab assigned for `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl` container. This container should be listed on Containers page for DSDL app.\
* Follow the steps below inside Jupyter Notebook:\
* Upload the `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz` file into `app/model/data/detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl/` path using the upload option in the Jupyter Notebook.\
* Untar the artifact `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz` using `tar -xf app/model/data/detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.tar.gz -C app/model/data/detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl/`.\
* Upload `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.ipynb` into the Jupyter Notebooks folder using the upload option in Jupyter Notebook.\
* Save the notebook using the save option in Jupyter Notebook.\
* Upload `detect_suspicious_processnames_using_pretrained_model_in_dsdl.json` into `notebooks/data` folder.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present if a suspicious processname is similar to a benign processname.
