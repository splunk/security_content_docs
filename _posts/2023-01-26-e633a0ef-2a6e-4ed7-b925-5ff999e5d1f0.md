#### Description

This analytic identifies a genuine DC promotion event. Identifying when a computer assigns itself the necessary SPNs to function as a domain controller. Note these events are triggered on the existing domain controllers, not the newly joined domain controller. This detection will serve to identify rogue DCs added to the network. There are 2x detections within this analytic story which identify DCShadow attacks, if you do not currently possess the logging for these detections, remove the where clause within this detection to identify DCShadow activity.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_domain_controller_promotion_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ServicePrincipalNames
* src_user
* user
* Logon_ID
* dvc



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting eventcode `4742`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Computer Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
None.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 80 | 100 | AD Domain Controller Promotion Event Detected for $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
