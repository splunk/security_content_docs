#### Description

The following analytic detects the disabling of audit policies on a domain controller. The detection is made by identifying changes made to audit policies and checks for the removal of success or failure auditing, which are common indicators of policy tampering. The detection is important because it indicates that an attacker has gained access to the domain controller and is attempting to evade detection and cover up malicious activity. The impact of such an attack can be severe, including data theft, privilege escalation, and compromise of the entire network. False positives might occur since legitimate changes to audit policies might also trigger the analytic. Upon triage, review the audit policy change event and investigate the source of the change. Additionally, you must capture and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts and review concurrent processes to identify the attack source.&#34;

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_domain_controller_audit_policy_disabled_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [advanced_audit_policy_guids](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/advanced_audit_policy_guids.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/advanced_audit_policy_guids.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* AuditPolicyChanges
* SubcategoryGuid



#### How To Implement
Ensure you are ingesting EventCode `4719` from your domain controllers, the category domain_controller exists in assets and identities, and that assets and identities is enabled. If A&amp;I is not configured, you will need to manually filter the results within the base search.
#### Known False Positives

> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
