#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_domain_controller_audit_policy_disabled_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [advanced_audit_policy_guids](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/advanced_audit_policy_guids.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/advanced_audit_policy_guids.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* AuditPolicyChanges
* SubcategoryGuid



#### How To Implement
Ensure you are ingesting EventCode `4719` from your domain controllers, the category domain_controller exists in assets and identities, and that assets and identities is enabled. If A&amp;I is not configured, you will need to manually filter the results within the base search.
#### Known False Positives
Unknown

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 60.0 | 100 | 60 | GPO $SubCategory$ of $Category$ was disabled on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
