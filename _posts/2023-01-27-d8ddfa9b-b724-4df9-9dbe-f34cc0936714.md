#### Description

The following analytic identifies when a certificate is exported from the Windows Certificate Store. This analytic utilizes the Certificates Lifecycle log channel event ID 1007. EventID 1007 is focused on the Export of a certificate from the local certificate store. In addition, review the ProcessName field as it will help to determine automation/Admin or adversary extracting the certificate. Depending on the organization, the certificate may be used for authentication to the VPN or private resources.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [certificateservices_lifecycle](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/certificateservices_lifecycle.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_export_certificate_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* dest
* SubjectName
* UserData_Xml



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, you must collect Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System/Operational or Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-User/Operational.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be generated based on an automated process or service that exports certificates on the regular. Review is required before setting to alert. Monitor for abnormal processes performing an export.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 36.0 | 60 | 60 | An certificate was exported on $dest$ from the Windows Certificate Store. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
