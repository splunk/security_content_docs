#### Description

The following analytic identifies an AWS account with more than 20 failed authentication events in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent a brute force attack against the account. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the threshold of this detection.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud

#### Search

```
`cloudtrail` eventName=ConsoleLogin action=failure 
| bucket span=10m _time 
| stats dc(_raw) AS failed_attempts values(src_ip) as src_ip values(user_agent) by _time, user_name, eventName, eventSource aws_account_id 
| where failed_attempts > 20 
| `aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_high_number_of_failed_authentications_for_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventName
* userAgent
* errorCode
* requestParameters.userName
* eventSource
* user_arn
* aws_account_id
* src_ip



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk AWS Add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
#### Known False Positives
A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 50 | 70 | User $user_name$ failed to authenticate more than 20 times in the span of 5 minutes for AWS Account $aws_account_id$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
