### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.


[Try in Splunk Security Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/cyber-security.html){: .btn .btn--success}

#### Description

The following hunting / inventory query assists defenders in identifying Drivers being loaded across the fleet. This query relies upon a PowerShell script input to be deployed to critical systems and beyond. If capturing all via the input, this will provide retrospection into drivers persisting. Note, that this is not perfect across a large fleet. Modify the query as you need to view the data differently.

#### Search

```
`driverinventory` 
| stats values(Path) min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by host DriverType 
| rename host as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_driver_inventory_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [driverinventory](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/driverinventory.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_driver_inventory_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Path
* host
* DriverType



#### How To Implement
To capture the drivers by host, utilize the referenced Gist to create the inputs, props and transforms. Otherwise, this hunt query will not work.
#### Known False Positives
Filter and modify the analytic as you&#39;d like. Filter based on path. Remove the system32\drivers and look for non-standard paths.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 5.0 | 50 | 10 | Drivers have been identified on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
