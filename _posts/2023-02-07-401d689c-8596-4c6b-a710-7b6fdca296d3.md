#### Description

This search will enumerate all Splunk Accounts with administrative rights on this instance.  It deliberately ignores the default admin account since this is assumed to be present.  This search may help in a detection the Cross-Site Scripting Attack listed: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, a View allows for Cross-Site Scripting in an XML View through the &#39;layoutPanel&#39; attribute in the &#39;module&#39; tag. The vulnerability affects instances with Splunk Web enabled.

#### Search

```

| rest splunk_server=local /services/authentication/users 
|search capabilities=admin* OR imported_capabilities=admin* title!=admin 
| table title roles capabilities splunk_server 
| `splunk_list_all_nonstandard_admin_accounts_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **splunk_list_all_nonstandard_admin_accounts_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* capabilities
* splunk_server
* title



#### How To Implement
The user running this search is required to have a permission allowing them to dispatch REST requests to indexers (the `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` capability) in some architectures.  If there have been admin account, in addition to the standard admin account, intentionally created on this server, then edit the filter macro to exclude them.
#### Known False Positives
It is not possible to discern from the user table whether or not users with admin rights have been created intentionally, accidentally, or as a result of exploitation. Each user with these rights should be investigated and, if legitimate, added to the filter macro above.  If a user is not believed to be legitimate, then further investigation should take place.
