#### Search

```
index = _internal sourcetype IN ("splunk_web_service", "splunk_python") message="*loadParams*" 
| `security_content_ctime(_time)` 
|  table _time message fileName 
| `splunk_xss_via_view_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_xss_via_view_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* message
* fileName



#### How To Implement
This data is collected by default in Splunk.  Upon first enabling this rule, a number of errors may be observed. Those that are due to improperly formatted, but non-nefarious, XML views should be be remedied in the corresponding view. Please take care investigating potential XSS as accessing an affected page could retrigger the exploit.
#### Known False Positives
The error detected above can be generated for a wide variety of improperly formatted XML views.  There will be false positives as the search cannot extract the malicious payload and the view should be manually investigated.
