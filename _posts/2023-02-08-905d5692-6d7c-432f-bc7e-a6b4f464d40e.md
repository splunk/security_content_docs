#### Description

The following analytic utilizes a Windows Event Log - CAPI2 - or CryptoAPI 2, to identify suspicious certificate extraction. Typically, this event log is meant for diagnosing PKI issues, however is a great source to identify certificate exports. Note that this event log is noisy as it captures common PKI requests from many different processes. EventID 70 is generated anytime a certificate is exported. The description for EventID 70 is &#34;Acquire Certificate Private Key&#34;. STRT tested this analytic using Mimikatz binary and the implementation of Mimikatz in Cobalt Strike.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [capi2_operational](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/capi2_operational.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_steal_authentication_certificates_cryptoapi_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Computer
* UserData_Xml



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and the analytic only focuses in on EventID 70. Review the following gist for additional enabling information.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate applications requiring to export certificates. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 24.0 | 30 | 80 | Certificates were exported via the CryptoAPI 2 on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
