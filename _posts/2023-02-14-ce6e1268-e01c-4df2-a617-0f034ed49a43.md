#### Search

```
`audit_searches` path=/opt/splunk/etc/users/*/search/local/data/ui/views/* action=* 
|table user action roles info roles path 
| dedup user action 
| `persistent_xss_in_rapiddiag_through_user_interface_views_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [audit_searches](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/audit_searches.yml)

> :information_source:
> **persistent_xss_in_rapiddiag_through_user_interface_views_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* user
* action
* roles
* info
* roles
* path



#### How To Implement
This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index
#### Known False Positives
This is a hunting search, it will not deobfuscate base64 payload, it provides however it will provide what user added the view artifact and what user opened it. It will require further investigation based on the information presented by this hunting search.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A potential XSS attempt has been detected from $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
