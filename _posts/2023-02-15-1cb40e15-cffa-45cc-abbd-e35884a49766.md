#### Description

this detection was designed to identifies suspicious office documents that connect to a website aside from Microsoft Office Domain. This technique was seen in several malicious documents that abuses .rels xml properties of MS office to connect or download malicious files. This hunting query can be a good pivot or guide to check what URL link it tries to connect, what domain, where the documents came from and how the connection happens.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_spearphishing_attachment_connect_to_none_ms_office_domain_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Image
* QueryName
* QueryResults
* QueryStatus
* Computer



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
Windows Office document may contain legitimate url link other than MS office Domain. filter is needed

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 9.0 | 30 | 30 | a office document process $Image$ connect to an URL link $QueryName$ in $Computer$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
