#### Description

When an adversary utilizes SliverC2 to laterally move with the Psexec module, it will create a service with the name and description of &#34;Sliver&#34; and &#34;Sliver Implant&#34;. Note that these may be easily changed and are specific to only SliverC2. We have also created the same regex as Microsoft has outlined to attempt to capture the suspicious service path (regex101 reference).

| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Computer EventCode ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType 
| rename Computer as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [wineventlog_system](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_system.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_service_create_sliverc2_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* EventCode
* Computer
* ServiceName
* ImagePath
* ServiceType



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, the Windows EventCode 7045 will need to be logged from the System Event log. The Windows TA for Splunk is also recommended.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited, but if another service out there is named Sliver, filtering may be needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 90 | 100 | A user mode service was created on $dest$ related to SliverC2. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
