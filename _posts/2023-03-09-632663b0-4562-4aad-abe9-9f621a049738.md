#### Description

The following analytic utilizes Okta&#39;s ThreatInsight to identify &#34;Login failures with high unknown users count&#34; and any included secondary outcome reasons. This event will trigger when a brute force attempt occurs with unknown usernames attempted.

#### Search

```
`okta` eventType="security.threat.detected" AND outcome.reason="Login failures with high unknown users count*" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(displayMessage) by user eventType client.userAgent.rawUserAgent client.userAgent.browser outcome.reason 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `okta_threatinsight_login_failure_with_high_unknown_users_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_threatinsight_login_failure_with_high_unknown_users_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventType
* client.userAgent.rawUserAgent
* client.userAgent.browser
* outcome.reason
* displayMessage



#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested in your Splunk deployment.
#### Known False Positives
Fidelity of this is high as it is Okta ThreatInsight. Filter and modify as needed.

#### Associated Analytic Story
