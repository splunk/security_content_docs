### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic utilizes Okta&#39;s ThreatInsight to identify &#34;Login failures with high unknown users count&#34; and any included secondary outcome reasons. This event will trigger when a brute force attempt occurs with unknown usernames attempted.

#### Search

```
`okta` eventType="security.threat.detected" AND outcome.reason="Login failures with high unknown users count*" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(displayMessage) by user eventType client.userAgent.rawUserAgent client.userAgent.browser outcome.reason 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `okta_threatinsight_login_failure_with_high_unknown_users_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_threatinsight_login_failure_with_high_unknown_users_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventType
* client.userAgent.rawUserAgent
* client.userAgent.browser
* outcome.reason
* displayMessage



#### How To Implement
This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested in your Splunk deployment.
#### Known False Positives
Fidelity of this is high as it is Okta ThreatInsight. Filter and modify as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 50.0 | 50 | 100 | Okta ThreatInsight has detected or prevented a high number of login failures. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
