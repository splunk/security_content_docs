### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic identifies multiple failed app requests in an attempt to identify the reuse a stolen web session cookie. The logic of the analytic is as follows: \ * Retrieves policy evaluation and SSO details in events that contain the Application requested \
* Formats target fields so we can aggregate specifically on Applications (AppInstances) \
* Groups by User, Session and IP \
* Creates a ratio of successful SSO events to total MFA challenges related to Application Sign On Policies \
* Alerts when more than half of app sign on events are unsuccessful, and challenges were unsatisfied for more than three apps.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_multiple_failed_requests_to_access_applications_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* authenticationContext.externalSessionId
* targets
* actor.alternateId
* client.ipAddress
* eventType



#### How To Implement
This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta:im2 logs to be ingested.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present based on organization size and configuration of Okta.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 80 | 70 | Multiple Failed Requests to Access Applications via Okta for $actor.alternateId$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
