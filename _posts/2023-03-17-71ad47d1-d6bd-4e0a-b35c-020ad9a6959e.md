### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic looks for one or more policy evaluation events in which multiple client values (IP, User Agent, etc.) change associated to the same Device Token for a specific user. A detection opportunity arises when an adversary attempts to reuse a stolen web session cookie. \
* Retrieves policy evaluation events from successful authentication events. \
* Aggregates/Groups by Device Token and User, providing the first policy evaluation event in the search window. \
* Evaluates whether there is more than one IP and whether there is more than one OS or browser for each combination of User/Device Token.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [okta](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/okta.yml)

> :information_source:
> **okta_suspicious_use_of_a_session_cookie_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* client.ipAddress
* client.userAgent.rawUserAgent
* client.userAgent.os
* client.geographicalContext.city
* client.userAgent.browser
* device.os_platform
* debugContext.debugData.dtHash
* actor.alternateId



#### How To Implement
This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta:im2 logs to be ingested.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present based on organization size and configuration of Okta.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 80 | 70 | A suspicious use of a session cookie was identified by user $actor.alternateId$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
