#### Description

The following analytic leverages events 4625 and 4624 to identify an endpoint using the builtin local Administrator account to authenticate to a large numbers of endpoints. Specifically, the logic will trigger when an endpoints attempts to authenticate to more than 30 target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could represent an adversary who has obtained access to local credentials and is trying to validate if these credentials work on other hosts to escalate their privileges. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_local_administrator_credential_stuffing_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* Logon_Type
* TargetUserName
* Computer
* IpAddress



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also trigger this detection. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 70 | 80 | Local Administrator credential stuffing attack coming from $IpAddress$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
