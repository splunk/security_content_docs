#### Description

The following analytic leverages Event ID 4624 to identify a source computer authenticating to a large number of remote endpoints within an Active Directory network. Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source endpoint authenticates to 30 or more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could represent an adversary who is moving laterally across the environment or enumerating network shares in the search for sensitive files. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_rapid_authentication_on_multiple_hosts_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* Logon_Type
* TargetUserName
* Computer
* IpAddress



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also trigger this detection. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 48.0 | 60 | 80 | The source computer with ip address $IpAddress$ authenticated to a large number of remote endpoints within 5 minutes. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
