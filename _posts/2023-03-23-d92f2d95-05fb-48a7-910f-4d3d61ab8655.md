#### Description

The following analytic leverages Event IDs 5140 or 5145 to identify a source computer accessing windows administrative shares (C$, Admin$ and IPC$ ) across a large number remote endpoints. Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source endpoint accesses administrative shares across 30 or more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. This behavior could represent an adversary who is enumerating network shares across an Active Directory environment in the search for sensitive files, a common technique leveraged by red teamers and threat actors. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.

#### Search

```
 `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5140 OR EventCode=5145 (ShareName="\\\\*\\ADMIN$" OR ShareName="\\\\*\\IPC$" OR ShareName="\\\\*\\C$") 
| bucket span=5m _time 
| stats dc(Computer) AS unique_targets values(Computer) as host_targets values(ShareName) as shares by _time, IpAddress, SubjectUserName, EventCode 
| where unique_targets > 30 
| `windows_administrative_shares_accessed_on_multiple_hosts_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_administrative_shares_accessed_on_multiple_hosts_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ShareName
* Computer
* IpAddress
* SubjectUserName



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting file share events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Detailed File Share` or `Audit File Share` within `Object Access` need to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
An single endpoint accessing windows administrative shares across a large number of endpoints is not common behavior. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, administration systems and missconfigured systems.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 70 | 80 | $IpAddress$ accessed the IPC share on more than 30 endpoints in a timespan of 5 minutes. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
