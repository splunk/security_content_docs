#### Description

The following analytic detects the use of the PowerShell script block logging mechanism to detect the use of the Win32_ScheduledJob WMI class. This class allows the creation and management of scheduled tasks on Windows systems. However, due to security concerns, the class has been disabled by default in Windows systems, and its use must be explicitly enabled by modifying the registry. As a result, the detection of the use of this class may indicate malicious activity, especially if the class was enabled on the system by the attacker. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the use of Win32_ScheduledJob through PowerShell script block logging and to investigate any suspicious activity.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/powershell.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_powershell_wmi_win32_scheduledjob_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

* EventCode



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present based on legacy applications or utilities. Win32_ScheduledJob uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to create scheduled tasks on remote computers. It uses the DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) infrastructure to establish a connection with the remote computer and invoke the necessary methods. The RPC service needs to be running on both the local and remote computers for the communication to take place.
