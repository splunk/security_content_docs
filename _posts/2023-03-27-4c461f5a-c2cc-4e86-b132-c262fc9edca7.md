#### Description

The following analytic leverages Event ID 4672 to identify a source user authenticating with special privileges across a large number remote endpoints. Specifically, the logic will trigger when a source user obtains special privileges across 30 or more target computers within a 5 minute timespan. Special privileges are assigned to a new logon session when sensitive privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege are assigned. This behavior could represent an adversary who is moving laterally and executing remote code across the network. It can also be triggered by other behavior like an adversary enumerating network shares. As environments differ across organizations, security teams should customize the thresholds of this detection as needed.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_special_privileged_logon_on_multiple_hosts_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* Caller_User_Name
* Computer
* PrivilegeList



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting special logon events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Special Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` need to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
Vulnerability scanners or system administration tools may also trigger this detection. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | A source user $Caller_User_Name$ obtained special privileges on a large number of endpoints within 5 minutes. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
