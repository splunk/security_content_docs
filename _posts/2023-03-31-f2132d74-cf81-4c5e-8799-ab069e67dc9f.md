#### Description

This search looks for suspicious AWS AMI attribute modifications, such as sharing it with another AWS account or making the full AMI image public. Adversaries are known to abuse these APIs to exfiltrate sensitive organization information stored in the AWS Resources, there by its very important to monitor these seemingly benign API activity in Cloudtrail logs.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_ami_atttribute_modification_for_exfiltration_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 100 | 80 | AWS AMI from account $aws_account_id$ is shared externally with $accounts_added$ from $src_ip$ or AMI made is made Public. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
