#### Description

The following query utilizes Windows Security EventCode 4698, indicating &#39;a scheduled task was created&#39;, to identify potentially suspicious tasks. These tasks may be registered on Windows through either schtasks.exe or TaskService, and are set up to execute a command with a native Windows shell such as PowerShell, Cmd, Wscript, or Cscript.\
The search will return the initial and final times the task was registered, along with details like the &#39;Command&#39; set to be executed, &#39;Task Name&#39;, &#39;Author&#39;, whether it&#39;s &#39;Enabled&#39;, and if it is &#39;Hidden&#39;.\
Schtasks.exe is typically found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64. The DLL &#39;taskschd.dll&#39; is loaded when either schtasks.exe or TaskService is launched. If this DLL is found loaded by another process, it&#39;s possible that a scheduled task is being registered within the context of that process in memory.\
During triage, it&#39;s essential to identify the source of the scheduled task. Was it registered via schtasks.exe or TaskService? Review the job that was created and the command set to be executed. It&#39;s also recommended to capture and review any artifacts on disk, and identify any parallel processes within the same timeframe to locate the source.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **winevent_scheduled_task_created_to_spawn_shell_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* dest
* Task_Name
* Description
* Command



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required.
#### Known False Positives
False positives are possible if legitimate applications are allowed to register tasks that call a shell to be spawned. Filter as needed based on command-line or processes that are used legitimately.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 70.0 | 70 | 100 | A windows scheduled task was created (task name=$Task_Name$) on $dest$ by the following command: $Command$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
