#### Description

The following analytic detects the creation or deletion of a scheduled task using the schtasks.exe command-line tool with the &#39;create&#39; or &#39;delete&#39; flags. This behavior has been associated with threat actors like Dragonfly and the SUNBURST attack against SolarWinds. It replaces the previous analytic related to &#34;Scheduled Task used in BadRabbit Ransomware.&#34;\
Identifying the creation or deletion of scheduled tasks via the command line is significant for a SOC as it may indicate malicious activity, such as the establishment of persistence or unauthorized changes to critical systems. A true positive suggests potential compromise or an ongoing attack, highlighting the need for immediate investigation and response to mitigate the impact on the affected systems.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process) as process values(Processes.parent_process) as parent_process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe (Processes.process=*delete* OR Processes.process=*create*) by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter` 
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **scheduled_task_deleted_or_created_via_cmd_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
#### Known False Positives
While it is possible for legitimate scripts or administrators to trigger this behavior, filtering can be applied based on the parent process and application to reduce false positives. Analysts should reference the provided references to understand the context and threat landscape associated with this activity.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 56.0 | 70 | 80 | A schedule task process $process_name$ with create or delete commandline $process$ in host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
