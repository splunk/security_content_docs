#### Description

The following analytic leverages Event ID 4732 to identify the addition of a new member to the DnsAdmins group within Active Directory. . Members of the DnsAdmin group can manage the DNS service which most of the times runs on the Domain Controller. By abusing legitimate DNS management functionality, a member of the DnsAdmins group can escalate privileges by executing malicious code on a Domain Controller as SYSTEM. Security teams should monitor the modification of the DnsAdmins group and validate the changes are legitimate.

#### Search

```
 `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4732 TargetUserName=DnsAdmins 
| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(SubjectUserName) values(Computer) by MemberSid, TargetUserName 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_dnsadmins_new_member_added_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_dnsadmins_new_member_added_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* TargetUserName
* SubjectUserName
* Computer
* MemberSid
* TargetUserName



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, Domain Controller events need to be ingested. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Security Group Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
#### Known False Positives
New members can be added to the DnsAdmins group as part of legitimate administrative tasks. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 40.0 | 80 | 50 | A new member was added to the DnsAdmins group by $SubjectUserName$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
