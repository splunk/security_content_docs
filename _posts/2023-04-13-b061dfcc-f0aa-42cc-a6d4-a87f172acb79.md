#### Description

The following analytic refers to a detection mechanism designed to identify when the Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) feature is disabled within the Windows registry. HVCI is a security feature in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 that helps protect the kernel and system processes from being tampered with by malicious code. HVCI relies on hardware-assisted virtualization and Microsoft&#39;s Hyper-V hypervisor to ensure that only kernel-mode code that has been signed by Microsoft or the system&#39;s hardware manufacturer can be executed. This prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities to run unsigned code, like kernel-mode rootkits or other malicious software, at the kernel level. Disabling HVCI may expose the system to security risks and could be an indicator of a potential compromise or unauthorized activity. The analytic aims to detect and report events or configurations that lead to the disabling of HVCI.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_impair_defenses_disable_hvci_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Registry.registry_path
* Registry.registry_value_data
* Registry.registry_value_name
* Registry.process_guid
* Registry.action
* Registry.user
* Registry.dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will be limited to administrative scripts disabling HVCI. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 70.0 | 70 | 100 | HVCI has been disabled on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
