#### Description

The following analytic detects the behavior of dumping credentials from memory, a tactic commonly used by adversaries. Specifically, it targets the exploitation of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) in Windows, which manages system-level authentication. Threat actors can use the comsvcs.dll to exploit this process and obtain valuable credentials. The analytic identifies instances where the rundll32 process is used in conjunction with the comsvcs.dll and MiniDump, indicating potential LSASS dumping attempts. This tactic is often part of more extensive attack campaigns and is associated with numerous threat groups. Identifying this behavior is crucial for security operations center (SOC) analysts, as credential theft can lead to broader system compromise, persistence, lateral movement, and escalated privileges. It is important to note that no legitimate use of this technique has been identified so far. The impact of the attack, if a true positive is found, can be severe. Attackers can use the stolen credentials to access sensitive information or systems, leading to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other damaging outcomes. To implement this analytic, ensure that logs with process information are ingested from your endpoints. However, be aware of potential false positives, as legitimate uses of the LSASS process may cause benign activities to be flagged. Upon triage, review the processes involved in the LSASS dumping attempt, capture and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts, and look for concurrent processes to identify the attack source. By identifying and mitigating LSASS exploitation attempts early on, SOC analysts can better protect their organization&#39;s assets and prevent potential breaches.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [process_rundll32](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_rundll32.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **dump_lsass_via_comsvcs_dll_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
