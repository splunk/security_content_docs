#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious query on uninstall application list in Windows OS registry. This registry  is commonly used by legitimate software to store information about installed applications on a Windows system, such as their name, version, publisher, and installation path. However, malware, adversaries or even red-teamers can abuse this registry key to retrieve information stored in the &#34;Uninstall&#34; key to gather data about installed applications in the target host. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot to detect a possible suspicious process accessing this registry which is not commonly accessed by a normal user.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_query_registry_uninstall_program_list_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* object_file_name
* object_file_path
* process_name
* process_path
* process_id
* EventCode
* dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable &#34;Audit Object Access&#34; in Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both &#34;Success&#34; and &#34;Failure.&#34;
#### Known False Positives
Uninstall application may access this registry to remove the entry of the target application. Filter is needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A suspicious process $process_name$ accessing uninstall registry on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
