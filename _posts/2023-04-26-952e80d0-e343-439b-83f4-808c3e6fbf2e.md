#### Description

The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Azure AD PIM role. Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service within Azure Azure AD that enables administrators to manage, control, and monitor access to sensitive resources. PIM provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources. Once a user has been made eligible for an administrative role, she must activate this role assignment to perform the privileged actions. When a role is activated, Azure AD PIM temporarily adds active assignment for the role. While PIM can be leveraged as a powerful security control, it may also abused by adversaries to obtain privileged access. Security teams should monitor for the assignment and activation of PIM roles and validate their legitimacy.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azuread](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azuread.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_pim_role_assignment_activated_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* properties
* operationName
* userPrincipalName
* initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName
* result



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
#### Known False Positives
As part of legitimate administrative behavior, users may activate PIM roles. Filter as needed

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | An Azure AD PIM role assignment was activated by $initiatedBy$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
