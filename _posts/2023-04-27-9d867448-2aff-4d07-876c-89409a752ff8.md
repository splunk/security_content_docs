#### Description

This analytic is to detect a high frequency of file deletion relative to process name and process id /etc/ folder. These events was seen in acidrain wiper malware where it tries to delete all files in a non-standard directory in linux directory. This detection already contains some filter that might cause false positive during our testing. But we recommend to add more filter if needed.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **linux_high_frequency_of_file_deletion_in_etc_folder_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Filesystem.dest
* Filesystem.file_create_time
* Filesystem.file_name
* Filesystem.process_guid
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.action



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
#### Known False Positives
linux package installer/uninstaller may cause this event. Please update you filter macro to remove false positives.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | Multiple files delted in /etc/ folder on $dest$ by process GUID -  $process_guid$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
