#### Description

This correlation rule focuses on detecting potential threats associated with MITRE ATT&amp;CK T1649 (Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates). The rule is designed to identify instances where 5 or more analytics related to Windows Certificate Services analytic story that are triggered within a specified time frame, which may indicate a potential attack in progress. By aggregating these analytics, security teams can swiftly respond to and investigate any suspicious activities, enhancing their ability to protect critical assets and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **steal_or_forge_authentication_certificates_behavior_identified_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* All_Risk.analyticstories
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic
* source



#### How To Implement
The Windows Certificate Services analytic story must have 5 or more analytics enabled. In addition, ensure data is being logged that is required. Modify the correlation as needed based on volume of noise related to the other analytics.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present based on automated tooling or system administrators. Filter as needed.

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 72.0 | 80 | 90 | Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates Behavior Identified on $risk_object$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
