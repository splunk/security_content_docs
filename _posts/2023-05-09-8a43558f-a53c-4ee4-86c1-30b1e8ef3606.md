#### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.4, 8.2.10, and 8.1.13, a low-privileged user can bypass URL validation to perform a path traversal and access restricted and confidential information by targeting other users on the instance, including the admin user.  The only affected version of bootstrap which shipped with Splunk was version 2.3.1, so the search is targeted at that version alone.

#### Search

```
`splunkd_web` method=GET uri_path="*bootstrap-2.3.1*" file="*.js" 
| table _time clientip uri_path file status 
| `splunk_persistent_xss_via_url_validation_bypass_w_dashboard_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunkd_web](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_web.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_persistent_xss_via_url_validation_bypass_w_dashboard_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* file
* uri
* clientip
* user



#### How To Implement
This search does not require additional data to be ingested. This search requires ability to search _internal index. This search helps discover access to vulnerable bootstrap versions.
#### Known False Positives
This search will produce numerous false positives as it shows ANY accesses to vulnerable bootstrap Javascript files.  Accesses to these files occur during normal Splunk usage. To reduce or eliminate false positives, update the a version of Splunk which has addressed the vulnerability.

#### Associated Analytic Story

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 16.0 | 80 | 20 | Attempted access to vulnerable bootstrap file by $clientip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
