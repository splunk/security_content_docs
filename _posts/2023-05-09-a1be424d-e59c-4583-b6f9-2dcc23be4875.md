#### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and 8.1.14, a low-privilege user who holds the user role can see the hashed version of the initial user name and password for the Splunk instance by using the rest SPL command against the conf-user-seed REST endpoint. This can lead to a privilege escalation that lets the user take over the admin account on the instance.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunkd_web](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_web.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_low_privilege_user_can_view_hashed_splunk_password_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* clientip
* useragent
* file
* user
* method
* status



#### How To Implement
This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may assist in efforts to discover attempts to access con-user-seed file content.
#### Known False Positives
This search may produce false positives as accounts with high privileges may access this file. Operator will need to investigate these actions in order to discern exploitation attempts.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 81.0 | 90 | 90 | Attempt to access Splunk hashed password file from $clientip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
