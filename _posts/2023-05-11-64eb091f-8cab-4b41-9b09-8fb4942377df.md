#### Description

The following analytic identifies a new service WerFaultSvc being created with a binary path located in the windows winsxs path. Per the report, the Snake version primarily discussed in this advisory registers a service to maintain persistence on a system. Typically this service is named WerFaultSvc which we assess was used to blend in with the legitimate Windows service WerSvc. On boot, this service will execute Snakes WerFault.exe, which Snake developers chose to hide among the numerous valid Windows WerFault.exe files in the windows WinSxS directory. Executing WerFault.exe will start the process of decrypting Snakes components and loading them into memory.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [wineventlog_system](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_system.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_snake_malware_service_create_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* EventCode
* Service_File_Name
* Service_Type
* _time
* Service_Name
* Service_Start_Type
* Service_Account
* user



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows System logs with the Service name, Service File Name Service Start type, and Service Type from your endpoints.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited as this is a strict primary indicator used by Snake Malware.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 72.0 | 80 | 90 | A service, WerFaultSvc, was created on $dest$ and is related to Snake Malware. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
