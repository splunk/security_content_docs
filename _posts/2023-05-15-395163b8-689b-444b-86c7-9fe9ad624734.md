### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following hunting analytic is designed to monitor and detect potential exploitation attempts targeting a PaperCut NG server by analyzing its debug log data. By focusing on public IP addresses accessing the PaperCut NG instance, this analytic aims to identify unauthorized or suspicious access attempts. Furthermore, it searches for specific URIs that have been discovered in the proof of concept code, which are associated with known exploits or vulnerabilities. The analytic is focused on the user admin. Regex is used mainly because the log is not parsed by Splunk and there is no TA for this debug log.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [papercutng](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/papercutng.yml)

> :information_source:
> **papercut_ng_suspicious_behavior_debug_log_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* uri_match
* ip_match
* index
* sourcetype
* host



#### How To Implement
Debug logs must be enabled and shipped to Splunk in order to properly identify behavior with this analytic.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present, as this is based on the admin user accessing the Papercut NG instance from a public IP address. Filter as needed.

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [PaperCut MF NG Vulnerability](/stories/papercut_mf_ng_vulnerability)




#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Behavior related to exploitation of PaperCut NG has been identified on $host$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
