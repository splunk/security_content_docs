#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect potential exploitation attempts on publicly accessible PaperCut NG servers. It identifies connections from public IP addresses to the server and specifically monitors for URI paths commonly found in proof-of-concept (POC) scripts for exploiting PaperCut NG vulnerabilities. These URI paths have been observed in both Metasploit modules and standalone scripts used for attacking PaperCut NG servers. When a public IP address is detected accessing one or more of these suspicious URI paths, an alert may be generated to notify the security team of the potential threat. The team can then investigate the source IP address, the targeted PaperCut NG server, and any other relevant information to determine the nature of the activity and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **papercut_ng_remote_web_access_attempt_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.http_user_agent
* Web.http_method
* Web.url
* Web.url_length
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* sourcetype



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present, filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 63.0 | 90 | 70 | URIs specific to PaperCut NG have been access by a public IP against $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
