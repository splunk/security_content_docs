#### Search

```
`audittrail` action IN ("change_own_password","password_change","edit_password") AND info="granted" AND NOT user IN (admin, splunk-system-user) 
| stats earliest(_time) as event_time values(index) as index values(sourcetype) as sourcetype values(action) as action values(info) as info by user 
| `splunk_edit_user_privilege_escalation_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [audittrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/audittrail.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_edit_user_privilege_escalation_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* user
* action
* info
* _time



#### How To Implement
This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may assist in efforts to discover abuse of edit_user privilege.
#### Known False Positives
This search may produce false positives as password changing actions may be part of normal behavior. Operator will need to investigate these actions in order to discern exploitation attempts.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Possible attempt to abuse edit_user function by $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
