#### Description

The primary objective of this correlation rule is to detect and alert on potential privilege escalation activities within an organization&#39;s Active Directory (AD) environment. By identifying multiple analytics associated with the Active Directory Privilege Escalation analytic story, security analysts can gain better insight into possible threats and respond accordingly to mitigate risks. The correlation rule will trigger an alert when multiple analytics from the Active Directory Privilege Escalation analytic story are detected within a specified time frame. The rule will generate an alert if a predetermined threshold of correlated analytics is reached within the specified time frame. This threshold can be customized to suit the needs and risk appetite of the organization.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **active_directory_privilege_escalation_identified_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* All_Risk.calculated_risk_score
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic_id
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_technique_id
* All_Risk.tag
* All_Risk.analyticstories
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic



#### How To Implement
Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation. In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing, a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased as the analytic story includes over 30 analytics. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will most likely be present based on risk scoring and how the organization handles system to system communication. Filter, or modify as needed. In addition to count by analytics, adding a risk score may be useful. In our testing, with 22 events over 30 days, the risk scores ranged from 500 to 80,000. Your organization will be different, monitor and modify as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Activity related to privilege escalation has been identified on $risk_object$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
