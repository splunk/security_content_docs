#### Description

The following analytic identifies object access on Windows administrative SMB shares (Admin$, IPC$, C$). This represents suspicious behavior as its commonly used by tools like PsExec/PaExec and others to stage service binaries before creating and starting a Windows service on remote endpoints. Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse administrative shares for lateral movement and remote code execution. The IcedID malware family also implements this behavior to try to infect other machines in the infected network.

#### Search

```

| stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by ShareName IpAddress ObjectType SubjectUserName SubjectDomainName IpPort AccessMask Computer

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **network_share_discovery_via_dir_command_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* ShareName
* IpAddress
* ObjectType
* SubjectUserName
* SubjectDomainName
* IpPort
* AccessMask
* Computer



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Security Event Logs with 5140 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also required. Also enable the object Audit access success/failure in your group policy.
#### Known False Positives
System Administrators may use looks like net.exe or &#34;dir commandline&#34; for troubleshooting or administrations tasks. However, this will typically come only from certain users and certain systems that can be added to an allow list.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | $user$ list executable files or directory in known sensitive SMB share.  Share name=$Share_Name$, Access mask=$Access_Mask$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
