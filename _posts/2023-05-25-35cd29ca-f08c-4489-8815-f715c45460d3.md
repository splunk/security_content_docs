#### Description

The following analytic identifies the use of Ldifde.exe, which provides the ability to create, modify, or delete LDAP directory objects. Natively, the binary is only installed on a domain controller. However, adversaries or administrators may install the Windows Remote Server Admin Tools for ldifde.exe. Ldifde.exe is a Microsoft Windows command-line utility used to import or export LDAP directory entries. LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is a protocol used for accessing and managing directory information services over an IP network. LDIF, on the other hand, stands for LDAP Data Interchange Format, a standard plain-text data interchange format for representing LDAP directory entries. -i This is a flag used with Ldifde.exe to denote import mode. In import mode, Ldifde.exe takes an LDIF file and imports its contents into the LDAP directory. The data in the LDIF file might include new objects to be created, or modifications or deletions to existing objects. -f This flag is used to specify the filename of the LDIF file that Ldifde.exe will import from (in the case of the -i flag) or export to (without the -i flag). For example, if you wanted to import data from a file called data.ldif, you would use the command ldifde -i -f data.ldif. Keep in mind that while the use of Ldifde.exe is legitimate in many contexts, it can also be used maliciously. For instance, an attacker who has gained access to a domain controller could potentially use Ldifde.exe to export sensitive data or make unauthorized changes to the directory. Therefore, it&#39;s important to monitor for unusual or unauthorized use of this tool.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=ldifde.exe Processes.process IN ("*-i *", "*-f *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_ldifde_directory_object_behavior_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ldifde_directory_object_behavior_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present, filter as needed.

> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
