#### Description

The following analytic identifies when a new certificate is requested and/or granted against the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) using a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). This action by its self is not malicious, however improperly configured certificate templates can be abused to permit privilege escalation and environment compromise due to over permissive settings (AD CS ESC1)

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_steal_authentication_certificates_-_esc1_abuse_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Attributes
* Computer
* EventCode
* Requester
* RequestId



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, enhanced Audit Logging must be enabled on AD CS and within Group Policy Management for CS server. See Page 115 of first reference. Recommend throttle correlation by RequestId/ssl_serial at minimum.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be generated in environments where administrative users or processes are allowed to generate certificates with Subject Alternative Names. Sources or templates used in these processes may need to be tuned out for accurate function.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 60.0 | 100 | 60 | Possible AD CS ESC1 activity by $src_user$ - $flavor_text$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
