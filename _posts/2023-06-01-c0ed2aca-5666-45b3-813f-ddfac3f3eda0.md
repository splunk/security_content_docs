### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects the creation of new ASPX files in the MOVEit Transfer application&#39;s &#34;wwwroot&#34; directory. This activity is indicative of the recent critical vulnerability found in MOVEit Transfer, where threat actors have been observed exploiting a zero-day vulnerability to install a malicious ASPX file (e.g., &#34;human2.aspx&#34;) in the wwwroot directory. The injected file could then be used to exfiltrate sensitive data, including user credentials and file metadata. The vulnerability affects the MOVEit Transfer managed file transfer software developed by Progress, a subsidiary of US-based Progress Software Corporation. This analytic requires endpoint data reflecting process and filesystem activity. The identified process must be responsible for the creation of new ASPX or ASHX files in the specified directory.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_moveit_transfer_writing_aspx_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.process_id
* Filesystem.file_name
* Filesystem.file_hash
* Filesystem.user
* Filesystem.file_create_time
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node and `Filesystem` node.
#### Known False Positives
The query is structured in a way that `action` (read, create) is not defined. Review the results of this query, filter, and tune as necessary. It may be necessary to generate this query specific to your endpoint product.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | The MOVEit application on $dest$ has written a new ASPX file to disk. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
