#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [amazon_security_lake](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/amazon_security_lake.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **asl_aws_excessive_security_scanning_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* api.operation
* identity.user.account_uid
* identity.user.name
* http_request.user_agent
* src_endpoint.ip



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format.
#### Known False Positives
While this search has no known false positives.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 18.0 | 30 | 60 | user $identity.user.name$ has excessive number of api calls. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
