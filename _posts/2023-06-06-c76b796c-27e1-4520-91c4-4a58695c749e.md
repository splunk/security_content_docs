#### Description

This analytic aims to identify potential adversaries who manipulate the security permissions of specific files or directories. This technique is frequently observed in the tradecraft of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and coinminer scripts. By modifying the security permissions, adversaries seek to evade detection and impede access to their component files. Such actions indicate a deliberate effort to maintain control over compromised systems and hinder investigation or remediation efforts. Detecting these security permission changes can serve as a valuable indicator of an ongoing attack and enable timely response to mitigate the impact of the adversary&#39;s activities.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name IN( "icacls.exe", "cacls.exe","xcacls.exe") AND Processes.process IN ("*:R*", "*:W*", "*:F*", "*:C*",, "*:N*","*/P*", "*/E*") by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user

| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_files_and_dirs_access_rights_modification_via_icacls_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_files_and_dirs_access_rights_modification_via_icacls_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_guid
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.process



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
#### Known False Positives
Unknown. It is possible some administrative scripts use ICacls. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | Process name $process_name$ with access right modification argument executed by $user$ to change security permission of a specific file or directory on host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
