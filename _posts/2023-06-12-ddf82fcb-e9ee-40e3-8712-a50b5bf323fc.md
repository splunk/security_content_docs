#### Description

The following analytic detects potential malicious activities related to PowerShell&#39;s task scheduling cmdlets. It looks for anomalies in PowerShell logs, specifically EventCode 4104, associated with script block logging. The analytic flags unusual or suspicious use patterns of key task-related cmdlets such as &#39;New-ScheduledTask&#39;, &#39;Set-ScheduledTask&#39;, and others, which are often used by attackers for persistence and remote execution of malicious code. If a true positive is found, it suggests an possible attacker is attempting to persist within the environment or potentially deliver additional malicious payloads, leading to data theft, ransomware, or other damaging outcomes. To implement this analytic, PowerShell Script Block Logging needs to be enabled on some or all endpoints. Analysts should be aware of benign administrative tasks that can trigger alerts and tune the analytic accordingly to reduce false positives. Upon triage, review the PowerShell

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/powershell.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_powershell_scheduletask_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
#### Known False Positives
Benign administrative tasks can also trigger alerts, necessitating a firm understanding of the typical system behavior and precise tuning of the analytic to reduce false positives.
