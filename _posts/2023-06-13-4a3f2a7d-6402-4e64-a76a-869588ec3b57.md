#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious PowerShell script execution via EventCode 4104 that contains multiple URLs within a function or array. This is typically found in obfuscated PowerShell or PowerShell executing embedded .NET or binary files that are attempting to download 2nd stage payloads. During triage, review parallel processes within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other related artifacts.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/powershell.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **powershell_script_block_with_url_chain_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ActivityID
* Computer
* ScriptBlockText



#### How To Implement
The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
#### Known False Positives
Unknown, possible custom scripting.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 100 | 80 | A suspicious powershell script used by $user$ on host $dest$ contains $url_count$ URLs in an array, this is commonly used for malware. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
