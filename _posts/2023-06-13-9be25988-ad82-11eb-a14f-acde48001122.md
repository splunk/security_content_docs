#### Description

This analytic identifies a suspicious processes running in file paths that are not typically associated with legitimate software. Adversaries often employ this technique to drop and execute malicious executables in accessible locations that do not require administrative privileges. By monitoring for processes running in such unconventional file paths, we can identify potential indicators of compromise and proactively respond to malicious activity. This analytic plays a crucial role in enhancing system security by pinpointing suspicious behaviors commonly associated with malware and unauthorized software execution.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process_name) as process_name values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\fonts\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\temp\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\users\\public\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\windows\\debug\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\Users\\Administrator\\Music\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\Windows\\servicing\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\Users\\Default\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*Recycle.bin*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\Windows\\Media\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "\\Windows\\repair\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\temp\\*" OR Processes.process_path = "*\\PerfLogs\\*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_path Processes.dest Processes.user

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **suspicious_process_file_path_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in non-standard paths. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | Suspicious process $process_name$ running from a suspicious process path- $process_path$ on host- $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
