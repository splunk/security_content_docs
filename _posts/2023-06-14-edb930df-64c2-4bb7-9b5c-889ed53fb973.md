#### Description

The following correlation identifies a four or more number of distinct analytics associated with the Windows Post-Exploitation analytic story, which enables the identification of potentially suspicious behavior. Windows Post-Exploitation refers to the phase that occurs after an attacker successfully compromises a Windows system. During this stage, attackers strive to maintain persistence, gather sensitive information, escalate privileges, and exploit the compromised environment further. Timely detection of post-exploitation activities is crucial for prompt response and effective mitigation. Common post-exploitation detections encompass identifying suspicious processes or services running on the system, detecting unusual network connections or traffic patterns, identifying modifications to system files or registry entries, monitoring abnormal user account activities, and flagging unauthorized privilege escalations. Ensuring the detection of post-exploitation activities is essential to proactively prevent further compromise, minimize damage, and restore the security of the Windows environment.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_post_exploitation_risk_behavior_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Risk.analyticstories
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic
* source



#### How To Implement
Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation. In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing, a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased base on internal testing. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | An increase of Windows Post Exploitation behavior has been detected on $risk_object$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
