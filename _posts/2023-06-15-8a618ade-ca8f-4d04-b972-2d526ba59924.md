#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious remote thread execution in some process being abused by threat actor and malware like qakbot. Qakbot is one of the malware using this technique to load its malicious dll module or malicious code in the targeted host. This TTP can be a good pivot to verify what is the behavior of the targeted Image process after this detection trigger. look for network connection, child process execution, file access and many more that helps to verify the indication of malware infection.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_process_injection_remote_thread_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* SourceImage
* TargetImage
* TargetProcessId
* SourceProcessId
* StartAddress
* EventCode
* Computer
* signature
* TargetProcessGuid
* SourceProcessGuid
* StartAddress



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts like remote thread EventCode=8 of sysmon. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
unknown

#### Associated Analytic Story
* [Qakbot](/stories/qakbot)
* [Graceful Wipe Out Attack](/stories/graceful_wipe_out_attack)




#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | process $SourceImage$ create a remote thread to process $TargetImage$ on host $Computer$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
