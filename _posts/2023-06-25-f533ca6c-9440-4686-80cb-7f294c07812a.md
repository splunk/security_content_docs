#### Description

The following analytic identifies when the attacker tool  Certify is used through an in-memory PowerShell function to enumerate Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environments. The default command line arguments for the binary version of this tools are similar to PowerShell calls and perform near identical enumeration or exploitation functions.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/powershell.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_certify_with_powershell_script_block_logging_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell..
#### Known False Positives
Unknown, partial script block matches.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 100 | 90 | Certify arguments through PowerShell detected on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
