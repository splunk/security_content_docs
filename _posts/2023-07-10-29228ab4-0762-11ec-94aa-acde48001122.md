### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

This analytic identifies suspicious behavior related to ProxyShell against on-premise Microsoft Exchange servers. This analytic has been replaced by GUID d436f9e7-0ee7-4a47-864b-6dea2c4e2752 which utilizes the Web Datamodel. \
Modification of this analytic is requried to ensure fields are mapped accordingly. \
A suspicious event will have `PowerShell`, the method `POST` and `autodiscover.json`. This is indicative of accessing PowerShell on the back end of Exchange with SSRF. \
An event will look similar to `POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.json a=dsxvu@fnsso.flq/powershell/?X-Rps-CAT=VgEAVAdXaW5kb3d...` (abbreviated) \
Review the source attempting to perform this activity against your environment. In addition, review PowerShell logs and access recently granted to Exchange roles.

#### Search

```
`exchange` c_uri="*//autodiscover*" cs_uri_query="*PowerShell*" cs_method="POST" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, cs_uri_query, cs_method, c_uri

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [exchange](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/exchange.yml)

> :information_source:
> **exchange_powershell_abuse_via_ssrf_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* dest
* cs_uri_query
* cs_method
* c_uri



#### How To Implement
The following analytic requires on-premise Exchange to be logging to Splunk using the TA - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3225. Ensure logs are parsed correctly, or tune the analytic for your environment.
#### Known False Positives
Limited false positives, however, tune as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 80 | 100 | Activity related to ProxyShell has been identified on $dest$. Review events and take action accordingly. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
