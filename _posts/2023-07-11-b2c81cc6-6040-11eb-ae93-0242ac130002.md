#### Description

This search is designed to detect the creation of a new Federation setting by alerting on a specific event associated with its creation. By monitoring for this event, the search can identify any instances where a Federation setting is being created within the system. This can help in detecting and monitoring any unauthorized or suspicious changes to the Federation settings, providing an additional layer of security for your environment.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_add_app_role_assignment_grant_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Workload
* Operation
* Actor{}.ID
* Actor{}.Type
* UserId
* dest
* ResultStatus



#### How To Implement
You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search works with o365:management:activity
#### Known False Positives
The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious, however this events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 18.0 | 30 | 60 | User $user$ has created a new federation setting $modified_properties_name$ on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
