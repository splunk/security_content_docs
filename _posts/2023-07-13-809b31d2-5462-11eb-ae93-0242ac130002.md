#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect modifications made to the built-in Windows error recovery boot configurations by searching for flags passed to bcdedit.exe. This behavior is commonly used by ransomware to prevent recovery and further damage the system. The analytic is implemented using a Splunk query that utilizes the Endpoint.Processes datamodel. It counts the occurrences of bcdedit.exe processes that include the &#34;*recoveryenabled*&#34; flag and exclude the &#34;*no*&#34; flag, and groups them by process name, parent process name, destination, and user. Identifying this behavior is important for a SOC as it can indicate the presence of ransomware or other malicious activity that aims to disrupt recovery efforts and potentially cause further damage to the system. If a true positive is detected, it suggests that an attacker has already compromised the system and is attempting to prevent recovery, which can lead to data loss or other negative outcomes. To investigate a potential true positive, analysts should review the details of the process, such as the source and the user who initiated it. They should also inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts and monitor for any concurrent processes that may indicate the source of the attack. By detecting this behavior early, analysts can take action to prevent further damage and mitigate the risks associated with ransomware attacks.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = bcdedit.exe Processes.process="*recoveryenabled*" (Processes.process="* no*") by Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.dest Processes.user 
| `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `bcdedit_failure_recovery_modification_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **bcdedit_failure_recovery_modification_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators may modify the boot configuration.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 100 | 80 | An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$ attempting disable the ability to recover the endpoint. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
