### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic searches for an instance where the `outlook.exe` process is being executed and writing a `.zip` file to the disk. The search is implemented using a Splunk query that utilizes the `Endpoint.Processes` and `Endpoint.Filesystem` datamodels. The search looks for instances where the `outlook.exe` process is being executed and writing a `.zip` file to the disk. It then joins the results with information on the file path, file name, and file hash from the `Endpoint.Filesystem` datamodel. Identifying this behavior is important for a SOC as it could indicate a potential data exfiltration attempt. If a true positive is found, it suggests that an attacker may be using the `outlook.exe` process to compress and transfer sensitive data from the victim&#39;s system. To implement this analytic, ensure that you are ingesting logs containing process and filesystem information from your endpoints. It is important to note that there may be legitimate uses of the `outlook.exe` process that involve writing `.zip` files to the disk, so be aware of potential false positives. Upon triage, review the file path and file name of the `.zip` file to determine if it contains sensitive information. Additionally, investigate the source of the `outlook.exe` process to identify any potential malicious activity.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_outlook_exe_writing_a_zip_file_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

* _time
* Processes.process_name

* Processes.process_id
* Processes.dest
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.user



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process, file name, and file path. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Filesystem` and `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
It is not uncommon for outlook to write legitimate zip files to the disk.
