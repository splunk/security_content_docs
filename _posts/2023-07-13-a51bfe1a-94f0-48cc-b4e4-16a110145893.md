#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect the use of tools that are commonly exploited by cybercriminals. These tools are often associated with malicious activities such as unauthorized access, network scanning, or data exfiltration, posing a significant threat to an organization&#39;s security infrastructure. To identify these activities, the analytic examines the process activity on the host, specifically focusing on processes that are known to be associated with attacker tool names. By doing so, it acts as an early warning system for potential security incidents, allowing security operations teams to respond promptly. However, it&#39;s important to note that while this analytic is effective in detecting malicious behavior, it may also generate false positives due to legitimate administrative activities that may resemble malicious actions. Therefore, it is crucial for cyber analysts to have a comprehensive understanding of typical endpoint activities and behaviors within their organization. This knowledge enables them to accurately interpret and respond to the alerts generated by this analytic, ensuring a proper balance between precision and minimizing false positives. Overall, implementing this analytic provides organizations with enhanced visibility into potential security threats, enabling proactive detection and response to mitigate the risks associated with cybercriminal activities.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **attacker_tools_on_endpoint_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [attacker_tools](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/attacker_tools.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.parent_process



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
Some administrator activity can be potentially triggered, please add those users to the filter macro.
