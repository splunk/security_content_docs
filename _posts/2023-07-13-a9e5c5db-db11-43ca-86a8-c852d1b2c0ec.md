#### Description

The following analytic searches for file modifications that commonly occur with Ransomware. The analytic detects modifications to files with extensions that are commonly used by Ransomware. It does this by searching for changes in the datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem, specifically modifications to file extensions that match those commonly used by Ransomware. Identifying this behavior is important for a Security Operations Center (SOC) because Ransomware is a common and dangerous type of malware that can cause significant damage to an organization&#39;s data and systems. If the search identifies a true positive, it suggests that an attacker is attempting to encrypt or otherwise modify files in the environment, potentially leading to data loss or other negative outcomes. To respond to a true positive, the SOC should investigate the affected system to determine the source of the modification and take appropriate action to contain and remediate the attack.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [ransomware_extensions](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/ransomware_extensions.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **common_ransomware_extensions_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Filesystem.user
* Filesystem.dest
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.file_name



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, file path and file name. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Filesystem` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
It is possible for a legitimate file with these extensions to be created. If this is a true ransomware attack, there will be a large number of files created with these extensions.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 90 | 100 | The device $dest$ wrote $file_count$ files to $path_count$ path(s) with the $file_extension$ extension. This extension and behavior may indicate a $Name$ ransomware attack. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
