#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect any suspicious modification of the firewall settings that enables file and printer sharing. This behavior is commonly seen in ransomware attacks, where the attackers attempt to discover more machines connected to the compromised host in order to encrypt more files. The analytic is implemented using a Splunk query that leverages the `Endpoint.Processes` datamodel and `process_netsh` to search for any processes related to firewall settings modifications. The query specifically looks for processes that contain the keywords &#34;*firewall*&#34;, &#34;*group=&#34;File and Printer Sharing&#34;*&#34;, and &#34;*enable=Yes*&#34;. If a true positive is found, it indicates that an attacker has attempted to modify the firewall settings to enable file and printer sharing, which could lead to data theft or further damage. Therefore, it is important for a SOC to identify this behavior and take immediate action to prevent any potential threats. In conclusion, this analytic is crucial for detecting any suspicious firewall settings modifications and helps SOC analysts to identify potential threats earlier, allowing them to take necessary measures to mitigate the risks.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [process_netsh](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/process_netsh.yml)

> :information_source:
> **allow_file_and_printing_sharing_in_firewall_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
network admin may modify this firewall feature that may cause this rule to be triggered.
