#### Description

The following analytic detects the execution of reg.exe with parameters that specify an export of keys containing hashed credentials that attackers may attempt to crack offline. This behavior is commonly used by attackers to dump and exfiltrate password hashes from the Windows Registry. The analytic leverages the datamodel=Endpoint.Processes and looks for processes with names containing &#34;reg&#34; or &#34;cmd&#34; and parameters containing &#34;save&#34; and specific registry keys related to security, SAM, and system. Identifying this behavior is crucial for a SOC as it can indicate that an attacker is attempting to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network. If a true positive is found, it suggests that an attacker has successfully obtained password hashes, which can be used to gain access to sensitive information, systems, and applications. To mitigate the risks associated with this attack, it is recommended to monitor for the execution of reg.exe with the specific parameters mentioned above. Upon detection, it is essential to investigate the source of the attack, review the registry keys accessed, and inspect any relevant on-disk artifacts to determine the scope of the attack. It is important to note that legitimate uses of reg.exe with the specified parameters may occur in the environment, leading to potential false positives. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the context of the activity and determine whether it is malicious or benign. Overall, monitoring for the execution of reg.exe with the specified parameters can help detect potential threats earlier and mitigate the risks associated with credential dumping attacks.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **attempted_credential_dump_from_registry_via_reg_exe_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 90.0 | 90 | 100 | An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified on endpoint $dest$ by user $user$ attempting to export the registry keys. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
