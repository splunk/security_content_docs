#### Description

This analytic is designed to assist in hunting for potential exploitation attempts against Citrix ADC in relation to CVE-2023-3519. This vulnerability, identified within Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway, appears to be linked with SAML processing components, with an overflow issue allowing for possible memory corruption. Preliminary findings indicate that for the exploit to be viable, SAML has to be enabled. The analytic targets POST requests to certain web endpoints which have been associated with the exploitation process. \
Given the specific nature of the vulnerability, upon deploying this analytic it is recommended to filter and narrow the focus towards your ADC assets to reduce potential noise and improve the signal of the analytic. Please note that the exploitation of this vulnerability has been reported in the wild, therefore monitoring for potential signs of exploitation should be considered high priority. \
The search query provided examines web data for POST requests made to specific URLs associated with the exploitation of this vulnerability. It aggregates and presents data to highlight potential exploitation attempts, taking into account elements like user agent, HTTP method, URL length, source, and destination. \
Please be aware that this analytic is based on current understanding of the vulnerability, and adjustments may be required as more information becomes available.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **citrix_adc_exploitation_cve-2023-3519_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.http_method
* Web.url
* Web.url_length
* Web.src
* Web.dest



#### How To Implement
This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present based on organization use of SAML utilities. Filter, or restrict the analytic to Citrix devices only.
