#### Description

The following analytic identifies a potentially suspicious execution of the &#39;pkgmgr&#39; process involving the use of an XML input file for package management. The &#39;pkgmgr&#39; process, though deprecated in modern Windows systems, was historically used for managing packages. The presence of an XML input file raises concerns about the nature of the executed command and its potential impact on the system. Due to the deprecated status of &#39;pkgmgr&#39; and the involvement of an XML file, this activity warrants careful investigation. XML files are commonly used for configuration and data exchange, making it crucial to ascertain the intentions and legitimacy of the command. To ensure system security, it is recommended to use up-to-date package management utilities, such as DISM or PowerShell&#39;s PackageManagement module, and exercise caution when executing commands involving potentially sensitive operations or files.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where  Processes.process_name = pkgmgr.exe Processes.process = "*.xml*" NOT(Processes.parent_process_path IN("*:\\windows\\system32\\*", "*:\\windows\\syswow64\\*", "*:\\Program Files*")) by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process_path Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_bypass_uac_via_pkgmgr_tool_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present on recent Windows Operating Systems. Filtering may be required based on process_name. In addition, look for non-standard, unsigned, module loads into LSASS. If query is too noisy, modify by adding Endpoint.processes process_name to query to identify the process making the modification.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 9.0 | 30 | 30 | A pkgmgr.exe executed with package manager xml input file on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
