#### Description

The following analytic detects addition of new service principal accounts added to O365 tenants. Attackers can abuse service principals in Office 365 (now known as Microsoft 365) to gain unauthorized access and perform malicious actions within an organization&#39;s environment. Service principals are essentially non-human accounts used by applications, services, or scripts to access resources and interact with APIs on behalf of the organization.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_added_service_principal_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Workload
* signature
* src_user
* src_user_type
* action
* Operation
* authentication_service



#### How To Implement
You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search works with o365:management:activity
#### Known False Positives
The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious, however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | User $src_user$ has created new service principal $new_value$ in AzureActiveDirectory |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
