#### Description

The following analytic identifies the execution of the Azure Device Code Phishing attack, which can lead to Azure Account Take-Over (ATO). The detection leverages Azure AD logs specifically focusing on authentication requests to identify the attack. This technique involves creating malicious infrastructure, bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and bypassing Conditional Access Policies (CAPs). The attack aims to compromise users by sending them phishing emails from attacker-controlled domains and trick the victims into performing OAuth 2.0 device authentication. A successful execution of this attack can result in adversaries gaining unauthorized access to Azure AD, Exchange mailboxes, and the target&#39;s Outlook Web Application (OWA). This attack technique was detailed by security researchers including Bobby Cooke, Stephan Borosh, and others. It&#39;s crucial for organizations to be aware of this threat, as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_device_code_authentication_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* category
* user
* properties.authenticationProtocol
* properties.ipAddress
* properties.status.additionalDetails
* properties.appDisplayName
* properties.userAgent



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
#### Known False Positives
In most organizations, device code authentication will be used to access common Microsoft service but it may be legitimate for others. Filter as needed.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | Device code requested for $user$ from $src_ip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
