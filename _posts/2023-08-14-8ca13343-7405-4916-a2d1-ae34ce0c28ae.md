#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that delete mark-of-the-web data stream. This technique has been observed in various instances of malware and adversarial activities aimed at circumventing security restrictions within the Windows Operating System, particularly pertaining to files downloaded from the internet. An example of this scenario is demonstrated by Ave Maria RAT, which attempts to delete this data stream as a means to evade such restrictions.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=23 TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier" 
| stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by user EventCode Image TargetFilename ProcessID Computer 
| rename Computer as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `windows_mark_of_the_web_bypass_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_mark_of_the_web_bypass_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* EventCode
* TargetFilename
* Computer
* user
* Image
* ProcessID
* _time



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the deleted target file name, process name and process id  from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
unknown

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | A mark-of-the-web data stream is deleted on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
