#### Description

The following analytic detects potential exploitation of the critical Adobe ColdFusion vulnerability, CVE-2023-26360. This flaw, rooted in the deserialization of untrusted data, enables Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read. Exploitation often targets specific ColdFusion paths, especially related to CKEditor&#39;s file manager. \
Our analytic pinpoints exploitation by monitoring web requests to the &#34;/cf_scripts/scripts/ajax/ckeditor/*&#34; path. This focus helps differentiate malicious activity from standard ColdFusion traffic. For SOCs, detecting such attempts is vital given the vulnerability&#39;s CVSS score of 9.8, signaling its severity. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, further attacks, or severe operational disruptions. \
If a true positive arises, it indicates an active breach attempt, potentially causing data theft, operational disruption, or reputational damage. In essence, this analytic provides a targeted approach to identify attempts exploiting a high-risk ColdFusion vulnerability. While false positives may occur from legitimate accesses, any alerts should be treated as high-priority, warranting immediate investigation to ensure security.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **adobe_coldfusion_unauthenticated_arbitrary_file_read_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.http_method
* Web.url
* Web.url_length
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* Web.http_user_agent
* Web.status
* sourcetype



#### How To Implement
This detection requires the Web datamodel to be populated from a supported Technology Add-On like Splunk for Apache, Splunk for Nginx, or Splunk for Palo Alto.
#### Known False Positives
In the wild, we have observed three different types of attempts that could potentially trigger false positives if the HTTP status code is not in the query. Please check this github gist for the specific URIs : https://gist.github.com/patel-bhavin/d10830f3f375a2397233f6a4fe38d5c9 . These could be legitimate requests depending on the context of your organization. Therefore, it is recommended to modify the analytic as needed to suit your specific environment.
