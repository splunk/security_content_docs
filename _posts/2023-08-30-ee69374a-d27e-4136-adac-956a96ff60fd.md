| ID          | Summary | [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| [CVE-2023-22931](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22931) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13 and 8.2.10, the ‘createrss’ external search command overwrites existing Resource Description Format Site Summary (RSS) feeds without verifying permissions. This feature has been deprecated and disabled by default. | None |
| [CVE-2023-22934](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22934) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the ‘pivot’ search processing language (SPL) command lets a search bypass [SPL safeguards for risky commands](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards) using a saved search job. The vulnerability requires an authenticated user to craft the saved job and a higher privileged user to initiate a request within their browser. The vulnerability affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. | None |
| [CVE-2023-22935](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22935) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the ‘display.page.search.patterns.sensitivity’ search parameter lets a search bypass [SPL safeguards for risky commands](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards). The vulnerability requires a higher privileged user to initiate a request within their browser and only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. | None |
| [CVE-2023-22936](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22936) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the ‘search_listener’ parameter in a search allows for a blind server-side request forgery (SSRF) by an authenticated user. The initiator of the request cannot see the response without the presence of an additional vulnerability within the environment. | None |
| [CVE-2023-22939](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22939) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the ‘map’ search processing language (SPL) command lets a search [bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards). The vulnerability requires a higher privileged user to initiate a request within their browser and only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. | None |
| [CVE-2023-22940](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22940) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, aliases of the ‘collect’ search processing language (SPL) command, including ‘summaryindex’, ‘sumindex’, ‘stash’,’ mcollect’, and ‘meventcollect’, were not designated as safeguarded commands. The commands could potentially allow for the exposing of data to a summary index that unprivileged users could access. The vulnerability requires a higher privileged user to initiate a request within their browser, and only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. | None |
| [CVE-2023-40598](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40598) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1, an attacker can create an external lookup that calls a legacy internal function. The attacker can use this internal function to insert code into the Splunk platform installation directory. From there, a user can execute arbitrary code on the Splunk platform Instance. | None |
| [CVE-2023-40598](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40598) | In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1, an attacker can create an external lookup that calls a legacy internal function. The attacker can use this internal function to insert code into the Splunk platform installation directory. From there, a user can execute arbitrary code on the Splunk platform Instance. | None |

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_risky_command_abuse_disclosed_february_2023_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [splunk_risky_command](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/splunk_risky_command.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/splunk_risky_command.csv)



#### Required fields
