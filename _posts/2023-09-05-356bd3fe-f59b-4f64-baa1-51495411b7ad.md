#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [splunk_python](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunk_python.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_absolute_path_traversal_using_runshellscript_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
Must have access to internal indexes. Only applies to Splunk on Windows versions.
#### Known False Positives
The command runshellscript can be used for benign purposes. Analyst will have to review the searches and determined maliciousness specially by looking at targeted script.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 50 | 70 | Possible attack against splunk_server $splunk_server$ through abuse of the runshellscript command |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
