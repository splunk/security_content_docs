#### Description

The following analytic identifies instances where the O365 advanced audit is disabled for a specific user within the Office 365 tenant. It leverages O365 audit logs, specifically events related to audit license changes or modifications within the AzureActiveDirectory workloads. The O365 advanced audit provides granular logging and insights into user and administrator activities, making it a crucial tool for security monitoring and incident response. Disabling this audit for a user can blind security teams to potential malicious or unauthorized activities related to that user&#39;s mailbox or account. Attackers may disable these audits to obscure their actions and reduce the chances of detection. If an attacker successfully disables the O365 advanced audit for a user, they can operate within that user&#39;s mailbox or account with reduced risk of detection. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, account compromise, or other malicious activities without leaving a detailed audit trail.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_advanced_audit_disabled_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Operation
* ExtendedProperties{}.Name
* ExtendedProperties{}.Value
* user
* object



#### How To Implement
You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators might temporarily disable the advanced audit for troubleshooting, performance reasons, or other administrative tasks. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 32.0 | 40 | 80 | Advanced auditing for user $object$ was disabled by $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
