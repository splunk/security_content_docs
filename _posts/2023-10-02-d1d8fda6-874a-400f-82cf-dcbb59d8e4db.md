#### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1, an attacker can execute a specially crafted query that they can then use to serialize untrusted data. The attacker can use the query to execute arbitrary code. The exploit requires the use of the &#39;collect&#39; SPL command which writes a file within the Splunk Enterprise installation.  The attacker can then use this file to submit a serialized payload that can result in execution of code within the payload.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [audit_searches](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/audit_searches.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_rce_via_serialized_session_payload_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

* info
* user
* search_type
* count



#### How To Implement
Requires access to the _audit index.
#### Known False Positives
There are numerous many uses of the &#39;makeresults&#39; and &#39;collect&#39; SPL commands. Please evaluate the results of this search for potential abuse.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | Potential abuse of the &#39;collect&#39; SPL command against $splunk_server$ by detected by $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
