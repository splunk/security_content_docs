#### Description

The following analytic utilizes a Windows Event Log - CAPI2 - or CryptoAPI 2, to identify failed trust validation. Typically, this event log is meant for diagnosing PKI issues, however is a great source to identify failed trust validation. Note that this event log is noisy as it captures common PKI requests from many different processes. EventID 81 is generated anytime a trust validation fails. The description for EventID 81 is &#34;The digital signature of the object did not verify.&#34; STRT tested this analytic using Mimikatz binary.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [capi2_operational](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/capi2_operational.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_sip_winverifytrust_failed_trust_validation_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Computer
* UserData_Xml



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, one will need to enable the Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational log within the Windows Event Log. Note this is a debug log for many purposes, and the analytic only focuses in on EventID 81. Review the following gist for additional enabling information.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present in some instances of legitimate binaries with invalid signatures. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | Failed trust validation via the CryptoAPI 2 on $dest$ for a binary. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
