#### Description

This following analytic detects when a process attempts to execute a file from within an NTFS file system alternate data stream. This behavior could indicate that a threat actor staged malicious code within a difficult to detect area of the file system and is now attempting to execute it.

- **Type**: [TTP](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Cloud
- **Datamodel**: [Endpoint](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Endpoint)
- **Last Updated**: 2023-10-30
- **Author**: Steven Dick
- **ID**: 30c32c5c-41fe-45db-84fe-275e4320da3f

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_alternate_datastream_-_process_execution_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
Target environment must ingest process execution data sources such as Windows process monitoring and/or Sysmon Event ID 1.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be generated by process executions within the commandline, regex has been provided to minimize the possibilty.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 100 | 80 | The $process_name$ process was executed by $user$ using data from an NTFS alternate data stream. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
