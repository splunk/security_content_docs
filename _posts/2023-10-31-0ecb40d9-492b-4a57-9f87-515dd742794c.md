#### Description

The following analytic is designed to detect any execution of AutoIt3, a scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. This includes instances where AutoIt3 has been renamed or otherwise altered in an attempt to evade detection. The analytic works by searching for process names or original file names that match &#39;autoit3.exe&#39;, which is the default executable for AutoIt scripts. This detection is important as AutoIt3 is often used by attackers to automate malicious activities, such as the execution of malware or other unwanted software. False positives may occur with legitimate uses of AutoIt3.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_autoit3_execution_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be present if the application is legitimately used, filter by user or endpoint as needed.
