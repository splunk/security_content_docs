#### Description

The following analytic identifies an AWS account successfully authenticating from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could represent an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same time as a legitimate user. As users may behave differently across organizations, security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

#### Search

```
 `cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin 
| bin span=5m _time 
| stats values(userAgent) as userAgent values(eventName) as eventName values(src_ip) as src_ip dc(src_ip) as distinct_ip_count by _time user_arn 
| where distinct_ip_count>1 
| `aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [cloudtrail](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/cloudtrail.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* eventName
* userAgent
* src_ip
* user_arn



#### How To Implement
You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works when AWS CloudTrail events are normalized use the Authentication datamodel.
#### Known False Positives
A user with successful authentication events from different Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 72.0 | 90 | 80 | User $user_arn$ has successfully logged into the AWS Console from different IP addresses $src_ip$ within 5 mins |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
