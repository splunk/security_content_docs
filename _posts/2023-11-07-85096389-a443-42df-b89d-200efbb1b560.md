#### Description

This correlation search looks at the risk events created by the detection analytics related Collection and Exfiltration techniques used by adversaries. The rule is designed to identify instances where 2 or more analytics unique AWS analytics and 2 or more distinct mitre IDs has triggered for a particular risk object. This alert when triggered may indicate a potential exfiltration in progress. By aggregating these analytics, security teams can swiftly respond to and investigate any suspicious activities, enhancing their ability to protect critical assets and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **aws_s3_exfiltration_behavior_identified_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* All_Risk.analyticstories
* All_Risk.risk_object_type
* All_Risk.risk_object
* All_Risk.annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic
* All_Risk.calculated_risk_score
* source



#### How To Implement
You must enable all the detection searches in the Data Exfiltration Analytic story to create risk events in Enterprise Security.
#### Known False Positives
alse positives may be present based on automated tooling or system administrators. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 81.0 | 90 | 90 | Multiple AWS Exfiltration detections $source$ and techniques $annotations.mitre_attack.mitre_tactic_id$ trigged for risk object $risk_object$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
