#### Description

The following analytic identifies the addition of a Service Principal Name to a domain account. While this event may be part of a legitimate action part of certain administrative operations, it may also be evidence of a persistence attack. Domain accounts with Servce Principal Names are vulnerable to a technique called Kerberoasting that enables attackers to potentially obtain the cleartext password of the account by performing offline cracking. An adversary who has obtained privileged access to a domain environment may add an SPN to a privileged account to then leverage the Kerberoasting technique and attempt to obtain its clertext password.

#### Search

```
 `wineventlog_security` EventCode=5136 AttributeLDAPDisplayName=servicePrincipalName OperationType="%%14674" 
| stats values(ObjectDN) as ObjectDN by _time, Computer, SubjectUserName, AttributeValue 
| rename Computer as dest SubjectUserName as user 
| `windows_ad_serviceprincipalname_added_to_domain_account_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_ad_serviceprincipalname_added_to_domain_account_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* EventCode
* ObjectDN
* signature
* SubjectUserName
* Computer



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you ned to be ingesting eventcode `5136`. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Directory Services Changes` within `DS Access` needs to be enabled. Additionally, a SACL needs to be created for AD objects in order to ingest attribute modifications.
#### Known False Positives
A Service Principal Name should only be added to an account when an application requires it. While infrequent, this detection may trigger on legitimate actions. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 30.0 | 60 | 50 | A Servince Principal Name for $ObjectDN$ was set by $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
