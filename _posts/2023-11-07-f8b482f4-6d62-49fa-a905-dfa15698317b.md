#### Description

The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution via EventCode 4104 that is processing cryptography namespace library. This technique was seen in several powershell malware, loader, downloader and stager that will decrypt or decode the next malicious stager or the actual payload. This Anomaly detection can be a good indicator that a powershell process to decrypt code. We recommend to further check the parent_process_name, the file or data it tries to decrypt, network connection and user who execute the script.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [powershell](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/powershell.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_powershell_cryptography_namespace_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A suspicious powershell script contains cryptography command detected on host $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
