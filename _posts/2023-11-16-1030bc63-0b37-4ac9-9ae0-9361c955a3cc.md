#### Description

This detection provides information about possible exploitation against affected versions of Splunk Enterprise 9.1.2. The ability to view JSON logs in the web GUI may be abused by crafting a specific request, causing the execution of javascript in script tags. This vulnerability can be used to execute javascript to access the API at the permission level of the logged-in user. If user is admin it can be used to create an admin user, giving an attacker broad access to the Splunk Environment.

#### Search

```
`splunkd_ui` "/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/authentication/users" status=201 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip, uri_path, method 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
| `splunk_xss_in_highlighted_json_events_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [splunkd_ui](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_ui.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_xss_in_highlighted_json_events_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* clientip
* uri_path
* method
* status



#### How To Implement
This search only applies to web-GUI-enabled Splunk instances and operator must have access to internal indexes.
#### Known False Positives
This is a hunting search and will produce false positives as it is not possible to view contents of a request payload. It shows the artifact resulting from a potential exploitation payload (the creation of a user with admin privileges).

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 15.0 | 30 | 50 | Possible XSS exploitation from $clientip$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
