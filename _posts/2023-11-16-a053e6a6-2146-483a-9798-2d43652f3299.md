#### Description

This search provides information to investigate possible remote code execution exploitation via user-supplied Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), affecting Splunk versions 9.1.x. Exploitation of this vulnerability by attackers requires that the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing is, or was, installed.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **splunk_app_for_lookup_file_editing_rce_via_user_xslt_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
Because there is no way to detect the payload, this search only provides the ability to monitor the creation of lookups which are the base of this exploit. An operator must then investigate suspicious lookups. This search requires ability to perform REST queries. Note that if the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing is not, or was not, installed in the Splunk environment then it is not necessary to run the search as the enviornment was not vulnerable.
#### Known False Positives
This search will provide information for investigation and hunting of lookup creation via user-supplied XSLT which may be indications of possible exploitation. There will be false positives as it is not possible to detect the payload executed via this exploit.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 1.0 | 50 | 2 | Please review $eai:acl.app$ for possible malicious lookups |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
