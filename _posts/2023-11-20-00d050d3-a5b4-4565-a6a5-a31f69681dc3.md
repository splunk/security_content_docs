#### Description

The following analytic detects when a process spawns an executable known for User Account Control bypass exploitation, and then monitors for any subsequent child processes that are above the integrity level of the original spawning process. This behavioral chain may indicate that an attacker has used a UAC Bypass exploit to successfully escalate privileges.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [uacbypass_process_name](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/uacbypass_process_name.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_uac_bypass_suspicious_escalation_behavior_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_guid
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name Processes.process
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.process_integrity_level
* Processes.process_current_directory



#### How To Implement
Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID 1 with process integrity level data.
#### Known False Positives
Including Werfault.exe may cause some unintended false positives related to normal application faulting, but is used in a number of UAC bypass techniques.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | A UAC bypass behavior was detected by parent process name- $parent_process_name$ on host $dest$ by $user$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
