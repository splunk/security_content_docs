#### Description

The following analytic detects when an executable known for User Account Control bypass exploitation, spawns a child process in user controlled location or a command shell executable (cmd, powershell, etc). This behavioral chain may indicate that an attacker has used a UAC Bypass exploit to successfully escalate privileges.

- **Last Updated**: 2023-11-20

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [uacbypass_process_name](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/uacbypass_process_name.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_uac_bypass_suspicious_child_process_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_guid
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name Processes.process
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.process_integrity_level
* Processes.process_current_directory



#### How To Implement
Target environment must ingest sysmon data, specifically Event ID 1 with process integrity level data.
#### Known False Positives
Including Werfault.exe may cause some unintended false positives related to normal application faulting, but is used in a number of UAC bypass techniques.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 45.0 | 60 | 75 | A UAC bypass parent process- $parent_process_name$ on host- $dest$ launched a suspicious child process - $process_name$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
