#### Description

The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to setup proxy server. This method has been exploited by various malware and adversaries to establish proxy communication on compromised hosts, facilitating connections to malicious Command and Control (C2) servers. Identifying this anomaly serves as a crucial indicator to unveil suspicious processes attempting to activate the proxy feature within the Windows operating system. Detecting such attempts becomes pivotal in flagging potential threats, especially those aiming to leverage proxy configurations for unauthorized communication with malicious entities.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_modify_registry_proxyserver_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Registry.registry_key_name
* Registry.registry_path
* Registry.user
* Registry.dest
* Registry.registry_value_name
* Registry.action



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | the registry settings was modified to setup proxy server on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
