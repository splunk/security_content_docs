#### Description

The following analytic identifies when a Windows Defender ASR rule disabled events. ASR is a feature of Windows Defender Exploit Guard that prevents actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. ASR rules are applied to processes and applications. When a process or application attempts to perform an action that is blocked by an ASR rule, an event is generated. This detection searches for ASR rule disabled events that are generated when an ASR rule is disabled.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [ms_defender](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/ms_defender.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_defender_asr_rule_disabled_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [asr_rules](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/asr_rules.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/asr_rules.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* host
* New_Value
* Old_Value
* Old_Registry_Value
* New_Registry_Value
* ASR_Rule



#### How To Implement
The following analytic requires collection of Windows Defender Operational logs in either XML or multi-line. To collect, setup a new input for the Windows Defender Operational logs. In addition, it does require a lookup that maps the ID to ASR Rule name.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may occur if applications are typically disabling ASR rules in the environment. Monitor for changes to ASR rules to determine if this is a false positive.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | ASR rule disabled event, $ASR_Rule$, was triggered on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
