#### Description

The following analytic identies scenarios where the same user session is accessed from multiple IP addresses. This situation typically arises in an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attack, where attackers compromise user sessions. The detection method involves analyzing Azure Active Directory logs for &#39;UserLoggedIn&#39; operations. It focuses on identifying sessions where the number of associated IP addresses exceeds one for the same SessionId. This pattern suggests potential unauthorized concurrent access, which is atypical under normal usage scenarios. If a true positive is identified, it implies that an adversary has gained unauthorized access to a user&#39;s Office 365 account. The ramifications of this can be significant, including data theft, account takeover, and launching of internal phishing campaigns.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_concurrent_sessions_from_different_ips_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | User $user$ has logged in with the same session id from more than one unique IP address |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
