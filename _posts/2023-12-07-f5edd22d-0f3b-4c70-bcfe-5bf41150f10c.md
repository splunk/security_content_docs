#### Description

The following analytic detects potential scanning activities within a Kubernetes environment. It identifies unauthorized access attempts, probing of public APIs, or attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. The analytic detects this behavior by monitoring Kubernetes audit logs for patterns indicative of scanning, such as repeated failed access attempts or unusual API requests. This behavior is worth identifying for a SOC as it could indicate an attackers preliminary step in an attack, aiming to gather information about the system to find potential vulnerabilities. The impact of such an attack could be severe, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [kube_audit](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/kube_audit.yml)

> :information_source:
> **kubernetes_access_scanning_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities. Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server. Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md.
