#### Description

The following analytic identifies parent processes that are powershell, spawning cmd.exe. By its very nature, many applications spawn cmd.exe natively or built into macros. Much of this will need to be tuned to further enhance the risk.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)
- **Product**: Splunk Behavioral Analytics

| eval process_file = process.file 
| eval process_file_path = process_file.path

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **detect_powershell_applications_spawning_cmd_exe_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* process.pid
* process.file.path
* process.file.name
* process.cmd_line
* actor.user.name
* actor.process.pid
* actor.process.file.path
* actor.process.file.name
* device.hostname



#### How To Implement
In order to successfully implement this analytic, you will need endpoint process data from a EDR product or Sysmon. This search has been modified to process raw sysmon data from attack_range&#39;s nxlogs on DSP.
#### Known False Positives
There are circumstances where an application may legitimately execute and interact with the Windows command-line interface.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | An instance of $parent_process_name$ spawning $process_name$ was identified on endpoint $dest_device_id$ by user $dest_user_id$, producing a suspicious event that warrants investigating. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
