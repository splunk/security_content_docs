#### Description

The following analytic identifies a potential suspicious process loading dll modules related to Graphicalproton backdoor implant of SVR. These DLL modules have been observed in SVR attacks, commonly used to install backdoors on targeted hosts. This anomaly detection highlights the need for thorough investigation and immediate mitigation measures to safeguard the network against potential breaches.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_known_graphicalproton_loaded_modules_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Image
* ImageLoaded
* process_name
* dest
* EventCode
* Signed
* ProcessId
* Hashes
* IMPHASH



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
#### Known False Positives
