### :warning: THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL DETECTION
This detection has been marked experimental by the Splunk Threat Research team. This means we have not been able to test, simulate, or build datasets for this detection. Use at your own risk. This analytic is **NOT** supported.

#### Description

The following analytic detects anonymous and unauthenticated requests to a Kubernetes cluster. It identifies this behavior by monitoring for API calls from users who have not provided any token or password in their request. This is a significant behavior to identify for a SOC as it indicates a severe misconfiguration that allows unfettered access to a cluster with no traceability to a user or service. The impact of such an attack could be substantial, potentially granting an attacker access to sensitive data or control over the cluster. This detection rule is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your Kubernetes infrastructure.

#### Search

```
`kube_audit` user.username="system:anonymous" user.groups{} IN ("system:unauthenticated") 
| fillnull 
| stats count by objectRef.name objectRef.namespace objectRef.resource requestReceivedTimestamp requestURI responseStatus.code sourceIPs{} stage user.groups{} user.uid user.username userAgent verb 
| rename sourceIPs{} as src_ip, user.username as user 
|`kubernetes_aws_detect_suspicious_kubectl_calls_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [kube_audit](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/kube_audit.yml)

> :information_source:
> **kubernetes_aws_detect_suspicious_kubectl_calls_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* objectRef.resource
* verb
* objectRef.name
* objectRef.namespace
* requestReceivedTimestamp
* requestURI
* responseStatus.code
* sourceIPs{}
* stage
* user.groups{}
* user.uid
* user.username
* userAgent
* verb



#### How To Implement
You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This search works with cloudwatch logs.
#### Known False Positives
Kubectl calls are not malicious by nature. However source IP, verb and Object can reveal potential malicious activity, specially anonymous suspicious IPs and sensitive objects such as configmaps or secrets

> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
