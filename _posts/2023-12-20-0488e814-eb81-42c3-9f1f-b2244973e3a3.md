#### Description

This analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method associated with a user account within Azure Active Directory by monitoring Azure AD audit logs and configurations. While adding a new MFA method can be a routine and legitimate action, it can also be indicative of an attacker&#39;s attempt to maintain persistence on a compromised account. By registering a new MFA method, attackers can potentially bypass existing security measures, allowing them to authenticate using stolen credentials without raising alarms. Monitoring for such changes is crucial, especially if the addition is not preceded by a user request or if it deviates from typical user behavior. If an attacker successfully registers a new MFA method on a compromised account, they can solidify their access, making it harder for legitimate users to regain control. The attacker can then operate with the privileges of the compromised account, potentially accessing sensitive data, making unauthorized changes, or even escalating their privileges further. Immediate action would be required to verify the legitimacy of the MFA change and, if malicious, to remediate and secure the affected account.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_new_mfa_method_registered_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* operationName
* properties.targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.displayName
* properties.targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.oldValue
* properties.targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue
* user



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
#### Known False Positives
Users may register MFA methods legitimally, investigate and filter as needed.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 30.0 | 60 | 50 | A new MFA method was registered for user $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
