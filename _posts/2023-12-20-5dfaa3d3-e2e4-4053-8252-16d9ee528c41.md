#### Description

The following analytic detects potential privilege escalation threats in Azure Active Directory (AD). The detection is made by running a specific search within the ingested Azure Active Directory events to leverage the AuditLogs log category. This detection is important because it identifies instances where privileged roles that hold elevated permissions are assigned to service principals. This prevents unauthorized access or malicious activities, which occur when these non-human entities access Azure resources to exploit them. False positives might occur since administrators can legitimately assign privileged roles to service principals.

| rename initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName as initiatedBy 
| rename targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue  as roles

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_privileged_role_assigned_to_service_principal_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [privileged_azure_ad_roles](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/privileged_azure_ad_roles.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/privileged_azure_ad_roles.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* properties.targetResources{}.type
* properties.initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName
* properties.result



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
#### Known False Positives
Administrators may legitimately assign the privileged roles to Service Principals as part of administrative tasks. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | A privileged Azure AD role was assigned to the Service Principal $displayName$ initiated by $initiatedBy$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
