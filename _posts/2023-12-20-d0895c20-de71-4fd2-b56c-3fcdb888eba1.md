#### Description

This analytic targets the detection of an unusually high number of denied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requests for a single user within a 10-minute window, specifically identifying instances where more than nine MFA prompts were declined by the user. Utilizing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) sign-in logs, particularly focusing on &#34;Sign-in activity&#34; events, it filters for scenarios where the MFA request was denied due to the user declining the authentication, as indicated by error code 500121 and additional details stating &#34;MFA denied; user declined the authentication.&#34; The data is then aggregated into 10-minute intervals, counting distinct raw events and capturing the earliest and latest times of occurrence for each user. This behavior is significant for a Security Operations Center (SOC) as it could be an early indicator of a targeted attack or an account compromise attempt, with an attacker having obtained the user&#39;s credentials and the user actively declining the MFA prompts, preventing unauthorized access. A true positive detection would imply that an attacker is on the verge of gaining full access to the user&#39;s account, posing a threat that could lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further malicious activities within the organization, necessitating immediate investigation and response to safeguard the organization&#39;s assets.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_multiple_denied_mfa_requests_for_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* category
* properties.status.errorCode
* properties.status.additionalDetails
* user
* properties.appDisplayName
* user_agent



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
#### Known False Positives
Multiple denifed MFA requests in a short period of span may also be a sign of authentication errors. Investigate and filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 54.0 | 60 | 90 | User $user$ denied more than 9 MFA requests in a timespan of 10 minutes. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
