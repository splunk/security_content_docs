#### Description

The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Application Administrator role to an Azure AD user. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. This role also grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the applications identity. If the applications identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the applications identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. Red teams and adversaries alike may abuse this role to escalate their privileges in an Azure AD tenant.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_application_administrator_role_assigned_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* user
* properties.targetResources{}.type
* properties.initiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName
* properties.result



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Auditlog log category
#### Known False Positives
Administrators may legitimately assign the Application Administrator role to a user. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | The privileged Azure AD role Application Administrator was assigned for User $user$ initiated by $initiatedBy$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
