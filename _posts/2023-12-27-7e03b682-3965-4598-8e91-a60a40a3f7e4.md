#### Description

The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious scheduled tasks in Windows, specifically tasks created using schtasks.exe with the -create flag and an XML parameter in the command-line. This technique is commonly employed by threat actors, adversaries, and red teamers to establish persistence or achieve privilege escalation on targeted hosts. Notably, malware like Trickbot and Winter-Vivern have been observed using XML files to create scheduled tasks. Monitoring and investigating this activity is crucial to mitigate potential security risks. It is important to be aware that scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic, leading to potential false positives. To minimize false positives, adjust the filter based on the parent process or application.\
When a true positive is detected, it suggests an attacker&#39;s attempt to gain persistence or execute additional malicious payloads, potentially resulting in data theft, ransomware, or other damaging outcomes. During triage, review the source of the scheduled task, the command to be executed, and capture any relevant on-disk artifacts. Analyze concurrent processes to identify the source of the attack. This analytic enables analysts to detect and respond to potential threats early, mitigating the associated risks effectively.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_scheduled_task_created_via_xml_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.process
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_id



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
It is possible scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic. Filter as needed based on parent process, application.
