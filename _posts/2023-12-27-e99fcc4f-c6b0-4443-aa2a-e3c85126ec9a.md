#### Description

The following correlation identifies instances where four or more distinct detection analytics are associated with malicious command line behavior that is known to be exploited by multiple threat actors, adversaries, or red teamers on a specific host. By leveraging the Command Line Interface (CLI), attackers can execute malicious commands, gain access to sensitive data, install backdoors, and engage in various nefarious activities. The impact of such compromise can be severe, as attackers may gain unauthorized control over the compromised system, enabling them to exfiltrate valuable information, escalate privileges, or launch further attacks within the network. If this detection is triggered, there is a high level of confidence in the occurrence of suspicious command line activities on the host.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_common_abused_cmd_shell_risk_behavior_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.

* source



#### How To Implement
Splunk Enterprise Security is required to utilize this correlation. In addition, modify the source_count value to your environment. In our testing, a count of 4 or 5 was decent in a lab, but the number may need to be increased base on internal testing. In addition, based on false positives, modify any analytics to be anomaly and lower or increase risk based on organization importance.
#### Known False Positives
False positives will be present based on many factors. Tune the correlation as needed to reduce too many triggers.
