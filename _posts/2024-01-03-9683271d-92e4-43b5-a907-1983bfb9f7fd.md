#### Description

The following analytic identifies a msiexec.exe process with hidewindow rundll32 process commandline. One such tactic involves utilizing system processes like &#34;msiexec,&#34; &#34;hidewindow,&#34; and &#34;rundll32&#34; through command-line execution. By leveraging these legitimate processes, QakBot masks its malicious operations, hiding behind seemingly normal system activities. This clandestine approach allows the trojan to carry out unauthorized tasks discreetly, such as downloading additional payloads, executing malicious code, or establishing communication with remote servers. This obfuscation through trusted system processes enables QakBot to operate stealthily, evading detection by security mechanisms and perpetuating its harmful actions without raising suspicion.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_msiexec_hidewindow_rundll32_execution_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.original_file_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.process_guid



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
Other possible 3rd party msi software installers use this technique as part of its installation process.
