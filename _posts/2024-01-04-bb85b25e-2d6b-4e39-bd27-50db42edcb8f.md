#### Description

In Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) versions below 7.1.2, an attacker can use investigation attachments to perform a denial of service (DoS) to the Investigation. The attachment endpoint does not properly limit the size of the request which lets an attacker cause the Investigation to become inaccessible.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [splunkd_investigation_rest_handler](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_investigation_rest_handler.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **splunk_es_dos_through_investigation_attachments_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* user
* status
* msg
* id
* object



#### How To Implement
This search requires access to internal indexes, only affects Enterprise Security versions below 7.1.2.
#### Known False Positives
This search will show the exact DoS event via error message and investigation id. The error however does not point exactly at the uploader as any users associated with the investigation will be affected. Operator must investigate using investigation id the possible origin of the malicious upload. Attack only affects specific investigation not the investigation manager.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | Denial of Service detected at Splunk ES affecting $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
