#### Description

The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry to change the health check interval of Windows Defender. Specifically, a value of 1 typically signifies that Windows Defender would perform health checks at a much higher frequency than the default settings. However, it&#39;s important to note that modifying this value to 1 might not necessarily conform to the actual behavior, as certain registry settings may have specific accepted values or a defined range that differs from a simple binary representation. Changing registry values, especially those related to system services, should be approached cautiously. Incorrect modifications can potentially impact system stability or performance. Always ensure you understand the implications and have a backup before altering registry settings.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_impair_defense_change_win_defender_health_check_intervals_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Registry.registry_key_name
* Registry.registry_value_name
* Registry.dest
* Registry.user
* Registry.registry_path
* Registry.action



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
#### Known False Positives
It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro to tune the search.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 49.0 | 70 | 70 | change in the health check interval of Windows Defender on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
