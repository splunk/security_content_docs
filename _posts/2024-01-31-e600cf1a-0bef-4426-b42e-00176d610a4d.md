#### Description

The following analytic detects when emails are accessed in Office 365 Exchange via Exchange Web Services (EWS), as indicated by the ClientInfoString field starting with &#34;Client=WebServices;ExchangeWebServices&#34;. It monitors mailbox activities, focusing on OAuth-authenticated applications that interact with EWS. The query aggregates key metrics such as access counts, timing, and client IP addresses, categorized by user, ClientAppId, OperationCount, and AppId. For defenders, it is critical to keep track of OAuth applications using EWS to access emails, as this information is instrumental in identifying and preventing potential abuse or unauthorized data access.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_oauth_app_mailbox_access_via_ews_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Workload
* Operation
* AppId
* ClientAppId
* OperationCount



#### How To Implement
You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
#### Known False Positives
OAuth applications may access mailboxes for legitimate purposes, you can use the src_ip to add trusted sources to an allow list.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 42.0 | 70 | 60 | An OAuth application identified with id $ClientAppId$ accesed mailboxes through the Graph API. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
