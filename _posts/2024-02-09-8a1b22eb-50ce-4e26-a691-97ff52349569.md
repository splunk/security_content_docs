#### Description

This detection targets situations where a service principal in Office 365 Azure Active Directory assigns app roles without the standard admin consent, a potential security breach. Using o365_management_activity logs, it examines the &#39;Add app role assignment to service principal&#39; operation, focusing on service principals and extracting details like role ID and description. This is critical for SOCs to detect potential bypassing of crucial administrative controls, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. A true positive implies a service principal might be misusing automated processes to assign sensitive permissions.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [o365_management_activity](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/o365_management_activity.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **o365_admin_consent_bypassed_by_service_principal_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
#### Known False Positives
Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 54.0 | 90 | 60 | Service principal $src_user$ bypassed the admin consent process and granted permissions to $dest_user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
