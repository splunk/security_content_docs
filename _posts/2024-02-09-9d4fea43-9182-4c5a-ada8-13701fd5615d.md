#### Description

This detection focuses on identifying instances in Azure Active Directory where a service principal assigns app roles without standard admin consent, using Entra ID logs. It operates on the azure_monitor_aad data source, scrutinizing the &#34;Add app role assignment to service principal&#34; operation, specifically from service principals. The query dissects details such as role ID, value, and description, important for understanding the nature of the roles being assigned. Monitoring this in a SOC is critical as it flags potential bypasses of vital administrative consent processes in Azure AD, which could result in unauthorized privileges being granted. A true positive detection suggests that a service principal may be exploiting automation to assign sensitive permissions without proper oversight.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_admin_consent_bypassed_by_service_principal_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* operationName
* targetResources{}.modifiedProperties{}.newValue
* targetResources{}.id



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the Auditlog log category
#### Known False Positives
Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 54.0 | 90 | 60 | Service principal $src_user$ bypassed the admin consent process and granted permissions to $dest_user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
