#### Description

Monitoring service principal authentication events in Azure Active Directory is crucial, but to effectively leverage this detection, teams should first conduct a thorough inventory of all service principals and their source IPs to establish a baseline of normal behavior. The detection, using azure_monitor_aad, specifically targets &#34;Sign-in activity&#34; within ServicePrincipalSignInLogs, gathering key details like sign-in frequency, timing, source IPs, and accessed resources. This baseline is essential for SOC teams to distinguish between regular application authentication and anomalous patterns that might suggest compromised credentials or malicious activities.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [azure_monitor_aad](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/azure_monitor_aad.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **azure_ad_service_principal_authentication_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* operationName
* category
* properties.resourceDisplayName
* properties.resourceId
* user
* src_ip
* user_id



#### How To Implement
You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
#### Known False Positives
Service Principals will legitimally authenticate remotely to your tenant. Implementing this detection after establishing a baseline enables a more accurate identification of security threats, ensuring proactive and informed responses to safeguard the Azure AD environment. source ips.
