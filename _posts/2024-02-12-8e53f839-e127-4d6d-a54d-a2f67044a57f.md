#### Description

The following analytic identifies the common command-line argument used by SOAPHound `soaphound.exe`. Being the script is publicly available, function names may be modified, but these changes are dependent upon the operator. In most instances the defaults are used. It does not cover the entirety of every argument in order to avoid false positives.

#### Search

```

| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name="soaphound.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="soaphound.exe" AND Processes.process IN ("*--buildcache *", "*--bhdump *", "*--certdump *", "*--dnsdump *", "*-c *", "*--cachefilename *", "*-o *", "*--outputdirectory *") by Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.process_current_directory Processes.process_name Processes.process_path Processes.process_integrity_level Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_path Processes.parent_process_guid Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process_id Processes.user

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_soaphound_binary_execution_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Processes.process
* Processes.dest
* Processes.process_current_directory
* Processes.process_path
* Processes.process_integrity_level
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.parent_process_path
* Processes.parent_process_guid
* Processes.parent_process_id
* Processes.process_guid
* Processes.process_id
* Processes.user
* Processes.original_file_nam



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
False positives should be limited as the command-line arguments are specific to SOAPHound. Filter as needed.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 80.0 | 80 | 100 | The process $process_name$ was executed on $dest$ related to SOAPHound. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
