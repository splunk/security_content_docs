#### Description

The following analytic identifies a suspicious query on outlook credentials registry in Windows OS registry. typically refers to user profiles associated with Microsoft Outlook. Within this key, Outlook stores configuration settings, including account information such as email addresses, server details, and authentication credentials. Accessing or modifying this registry key can potentially compromise users&#39; email security, making it a target for attackers seeking to steal sensitive information or execute unauthorized actions within Outlook. This anomaly detection is a good pivot to catch possible Trojan Stealer or RAT that tries to steal sensitive information to its targeted host.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_unsecured_outlook_credentials_access_in_registry_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.
