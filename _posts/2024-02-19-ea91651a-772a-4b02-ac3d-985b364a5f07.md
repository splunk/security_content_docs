#### Description

This analytic is designed to identify instances where Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) with a known history of being exploited are created in locations that are not typical for their use. This could indicate that an attacker is attempting to exploit the DLL search order hijacking or sideloading techniques. DLL search order hijacking involves tricking an application into loading a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one it was intending to load. This is often achieved by placing the malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the directory containing the legitimate DLL. Sideloading, similarly, involves placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL that an application is known to load, in a location that the application will search before finding the legitimate version. Both of these techniques can be used by attackers to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence on a system, and potentially elevate their privileges, all while appearing as legitimate operations to the untrained eye. This analytic aims to shed light on such suspicious activities by monitoring for the creation of known abused DLLs in unconventional locations, thereby helping in the early detection of these stealthy attack techniques.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_known_abused_dll_created_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [hijacklibs_loaded](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/hijacklibs_loaded.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/hijacklibs_loaded.csv)
* [hijacklibs_loaded](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/hijacklibs_loaded.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/hijacklibs_loaded.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process_guid
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.process
* Processes.parent_process
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Filesystem.dest
* Filesystem.file_create_time
* Filesystem.file_name
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.process_guid



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` and `Filesystem` nodes of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
This analytic may flag instances where DLLs are loaded by user mode programs for entirely legitimate and benign purposes. It is important for users to be aware that false positives are not only possible but likely, and that careful tuning of this analytic is necessary to distinguish between malicious activity and normal, everyday operations of applications. This may involve adjusting thresholds, whitelisting known good software, or incorporating additional context from other security tools and logs to reduce the rate of false positives.
