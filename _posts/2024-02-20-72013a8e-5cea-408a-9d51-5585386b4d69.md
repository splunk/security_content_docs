#### Description

The following analytic identifies a possible non-common browser process accessing its browser user data profile. This tactic/technique has been observed in various Trojan Stealers, such as SnakeKeylogger, which attempt to gather sensitive browser information and credentials as part of their exfiltration strategy. Detecting this anomaly can serve as a valuable pivot for identifying processes that access lists of browser user data profiles unexpectedly. This detection uses a lookup file `browser_app_list` that maintains a list of well known browser applications and the browser paths that are allowed to access the browser user data profiles.

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [wineventlog_security](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/wineventlog_security.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_credential_access_from_browser_password_store_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [browser_app_list](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/browser_app_list.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/browser_app_list.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* object_file_name
* object_file_path
* process_name
* process_path
* process_id
* EventCode
* dest



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable &#34;Audit Object Access&#34; in Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both &#34;Success&#34; and &#34;Failure.&#34; This search may trigger on a browser application that is not included in the browser_app_list lookup file.
#### Known False Positives
The lookup file `browser_app_list` may not contain all the browser applications that are allowed to access the browser user data profiles. Consider updating the lookup files to add allowed object paths for the browser applications that are not included in the lookup file.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A non-common browser process $process_name$ accessing browser user data folder on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
