#### Description

This analytic detects attempts to exploit the ConnectWise ScreenConnect CVE-2024-1708 vulnerability, which allows an attacker to perform path traversal attacks by manipulating the file_path and file_name parameters in the URL. The vulnerability, identified as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, enables unauthorized users to access sensitive files and directories on the host system, potentially leading to the exfiltration of sensitive data or the execution of arbitrary code. The search query provided looks for file system events that could indicate exploitation attempts. This detection is crucial for identifying and responding to active exploitation of this vulnerability in environments running affected versions of ScreenConnect (23.9.7 and prior). It is recommended to update to version 23.9.8 or above immediately to remediate the issue, as detailed in the ConnectWise security advisory and further analyzed by Huntress researchers.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **connectwise_screenconnect_path_traversal_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* Filesystem.file_create_time
* Filesystem.process_id
* Filesystem.process_guid
* Filesystem.file_name
* Filesystem.file_path
* Filesystem.dest



#### How To Implement
This analytic utilizes the Endpoint datamodel Filesystem node to identify path traversal attempts against ScreenConnect. Note that using SACL auditing or other file system monitoring tools may also be used to detect path traversal attempts. Typically the data for this analytic will come from EDR or other properly CIM mapped data sources.
#### Known False Positives
False positives are not expected, as the detection is based on the presence of file system events that indicate path traversal attempts. The analytic may be modified to look for any file writes to this path as it is not common for files to write here.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | A path traversal attack against ScreenConnect has been detected on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
