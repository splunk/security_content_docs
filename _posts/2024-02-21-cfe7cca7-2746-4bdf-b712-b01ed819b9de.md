#### Description

The following analytic identifies users who are unsually modifying security group in your cloud enriovnment,focusing on actions such as modifications, deletions, or creations performed by users over 30-minute intervals. Analyzing patterns of modifications to security groups can help in identifying anomalous behavior that may indicate a compromised account or an insider threat.\
The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the 3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number of users. To customize this analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the calculation of the `upperBound` field. This logic can be used for real time security monitoring as well as threat hunting exercises.\
This detection will only trigger on all user and service accounts that have created/modified/deleted a security group .\
The analytics returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source ip and values of the security objects affected.

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:

> :information_source:
> **cloud_security_groups_modifications_by_user_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Changes.object_id
* All_Changes.action
* All_Changes.status
* All_Changes.object_category
* All_Changes.user



#### How To Implement
This search requries the Cloud infrastructure logs such as AWS Cloudtrail, GCP Pubsub Message logs, Azure Audit logs to be ingested into an accelerated Change datamodel. It is also recommended that users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and outlier conditions to better suit with their environment.
#### Known False Positives
It is possible that legitimate user/admin may modify a number of security groups

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 35.0 | 70 | 50 | Unsual number cloud security group modifications detected by user - $user$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
