#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **wordpress_bricks_builder_plugin_rce_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* Web.http_user_agent
* Web.url
* Web.status
* Web.http_method
* sourcetype
* source



#### How To Implement
The search is based on data in the Web datamodel and was modeled from NGINX logs. Ensure that the Web datamodel is accelerated and that the data source for the Web datamodel is properly configured. If using other web sources, modify they query, or review the data, as needed.
#### Known False Positives
False positives may be possible, however we restricted it to HTTP Status 200 and POST requests, based on the POC. Upon investigation review the POST body for the actual payload - or command - being executed.
