#### Description

The following analytic detects when a known remote access software application traffic is detected from within the environment. Adversaries use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review the lookup for the entire list and add any others.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)

- **Datamodel**: [Network_Traffic](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkTraffic)
- **Last Updated**: 2024-02-22

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_remote_access_software_usage_traffic_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [remote_access_software](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* All_Traffic.src
* All_Traffic.dest
* All_Traffic.app
* All_Traffic.dest_port
* user



#### How To Implement
The following analytic was developed with Palo Alto traffic logs. Ensure that the logs are being ingested into Splunk and mapped to the Network_Traffic data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any additional remote access software that is used within the environment.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | Application traffic for a known remote access software [$signature$] was detected from $src$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
