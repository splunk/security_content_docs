#### Description

The following analytic detects when a known remote access software is executed with the environment. Adversaries use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review the lookup for the entire list and add any others.

- **Type**: [Anomaly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/wiki/Detection-Analytic-Types)

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_remote_access_software_usage_url_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [remote_access_software](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.action
* Web.src
* Web.category
* Web.url_domain



#### How To Implement
The detection is based on data that originates from network logs. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the network logs. The logs must also be mapped to the `Web` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
#### Known False Positives
It is possible that legitimate remote access software is used within the environment. Ensure that the lookup is reviewed and updated with any additional remote access software that is used within the environment.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A domain for a known remote access software $url_domain$ was contacted by $src$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
