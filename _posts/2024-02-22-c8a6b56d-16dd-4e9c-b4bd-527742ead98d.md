#### Description

The following analytic detects high volume of bytes out (greater than 1GB) to a URL within 2 mins of time window. This may be indicative of an attacker attempting to exfiltrate data.  The search applies a fundamental threshold for detecting significant web uploads. This approach aims to identify potential data exfiltration activities by malware or malevolent insiders. View the alert for $dest$ to investigate further.

#### Search

```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_summariesonly](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_summariesonly.yml)

> :information_source:
> **high_volume_of_bytes_out_to_url_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* Web.http_method
* Web.url
* Web.url_length
* Web.src
* Web.dest
* Web.http_user_agent



#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on Web traffic that include fields relavent for traffic into the `Web` datamodel. Please adjust the threshold for the sum of bytes out as per your environment and user behavior.
#### Known False Positives
This search may trigger false positives if there is a legitimate reason for a high volume of bytes out to a URL. We recommend to investigate these findings. Consider updating the filter macro to exclude the applications that are relevant to your environment.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 9.0 | 30 | 30 | A high volume of bytes out to a URL $url$ was detected from src $src$ to dest $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
