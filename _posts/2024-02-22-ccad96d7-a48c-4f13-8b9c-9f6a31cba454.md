#### Description

The following analytic detects when process with file or code signing attributes from a known remote access software is executed with the environment. Adversaries use these utilities to retain remote access capabilities to the environment. Utilities in the lookup include AnyDesk, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, TeamViewer and much more. Review the lookup for the entire list and add any others.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=1 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime, values(Company) as Company values(Product) as Product by dest, user, parent_process_name, process_name, process 
| lookup remote_access_software remote_utility_fileinfo AS Product OUTPUT isutility, description as signature, comment_reference as desc, category 
| search isutility = True 
| `detect_remote_access_software_usage_fileinfo_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

> :information_source:
> **detect_remote_access_software_usage_fileinfo_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### Lookups
The SPL above uses the following Lookups:

* [remote_access_software](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.yml) with [data](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/lookups/remote_access_software.csv)



#### Required fields
List of fields required to use this analytic.
* _time
* dest
* EventCode
* Company
* Product
* user
* parent_process_name
* process_name
* process



#### How To Implement
This analytic relies on Sysmon to be properly installed and utilized in the environment. Ensure that proper logging is setup for Sysmon and data is being ingested into Splunk.
#### Known False Positives
Known or approved applications used by the organization or usage of built-in functions.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 25.0 | 50 | 50 | A file attributes for known a remote access software [$process_name$] was detected on $dest$ |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
