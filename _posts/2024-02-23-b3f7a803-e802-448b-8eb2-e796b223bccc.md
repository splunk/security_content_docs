#### Description

This analytic detects attempts to exploit the ConnectWise ScreenConnect CVE-2024-1709 vulnerability, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication using an alternate path or channel. The vulnerability, identified as critical with a CVSS score of 10, enables unauthorized users to access the SetupWizard.aspx page on already-configured ScreenConnect instances, potentially leading to the creation of administrative users and remote code execution. The search query provided looks for web requests to the SetupWizard.aspx page that could indicate exploitation attempts. This detection is crucial for identifying and responding to active exploitation of this vulnerability in environments running affected versions of ScreenConnect (23.9.7 and prior). It is recommended to update to version 23.9.8 or above immediately to remediate the issue, as detailed in the ConnectWise security advisory and further analyzed by Huntress researchers.

#### Search

```

| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by src, dest, http_user_agent, url, uri_path, status, http_method, sourcetype, source

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [nginx_access_logs](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/nginx_access_logs.yml)
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)

> :information_source:
> **nginx_connectwise_screenconnect_authentication_bypass_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.



#### Required fields

* uri_path
* status
* http_method
* sourcetype
* source



#### How To Implement
To implement this analytic, ensure proper logging is occurring with Nginx, access.log and error.log, and that these logs are being ingested into Splunk. STRT utilizes this nginx.conf https://gist.github.com/MHaggis/26f59108b04da8f1d870c9cc3a3c8eec to properly log as much data with Nginx.
#### Known False Positives
False positives are not expected, as the detection is based on the presence of web requests to the SetupWizard.aspx page, which is not a common page to be accessed by legitimate users. Note that the analytic is limited to HTTP POST and a status of 200 to reduce false positives. Modify the query as needed to reduce false positives or hunt for additional indicators of compromise.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 100.0 | 100 | 100 | An authentication bypass attempt against ScreenConnect has been detected on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
