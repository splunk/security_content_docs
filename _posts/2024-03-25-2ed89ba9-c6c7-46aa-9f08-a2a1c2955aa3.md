#### Description

The following analytic identifies the abuse of SqlWriter and SQLDumper executables to sideload the vcruntime140.dll library. This technique is commonly used by adversaries to load malicious code into a legitimate process. The analytic searches for EventCode 7 from Sysmon logs where the Image is either SQLDumper.exe or SQLWriter.exe and the ImageLoaded is vcruntime140.dll. The search also filters out the legitimate loading of vcruntime140.dll from the System32 directory to reduce false positives.

#### Search

```
`sysmon` EventCode=7 (Image="*\\SQLDumper.exe" OR Image="*\\SQLWriter.exe") ImageLoaded="*\\vcruntime140.dll" NOT ImageLoaded="C:\\Windows\\System32\\*" 
| stats values(ImageLoaded) count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image,ImageLoaded, user, Computer, EventCode 
| rename Computer as dest 
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
| `windows_sqlwriter_sqldumper_dll_sideload_filter`
```

#### Macros
The SPL above uses the following Macros:
* [security_content_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml)
* [sysmon](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/sysmon.yml)

> :information_source:
> **windows_sqlwriter_sqldumper_dll_sideload_filter** is a empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

#### How To Implement
The analytic is designed to be run against Sysmon event logs collected from endpoints. The analytic requires the Sysmon event logs to be ingested into Splunk. The analytic searches for EventCode 7 where the Image is either SQLDumper.exe or SQLWriter.exe and the ImageLoaded is vcruntime140.dll. The search also filters out the legitimate loading of vcruntime140.dll from the System32 directory to reduce false positives. The analytic can be modified to include additional known good paths for vcruntime140.dll to further reduce false positives.
#### Known False Positives
False positives are possible if legitimate processes are loading vcruntime140.dll from non-standard directories. It is recommended to investigate the context of the process loading vcruntime140.dll to determine if it is malicious or not. Modify the search to include additional known good paths for vcruntime140.dll to reduce false positives.

#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   | Message      |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|--------------|
| 64.0 | 80 | 80 | An instance of $Image$ loading $ImageLoaded$ was detected on $dest$. |


> :information_source:
> The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact * Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
